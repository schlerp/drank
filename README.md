# Drank

A simple web app for viewing cocktails recipes.

## Developing

```bash
yarn

yarn dev
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
yarn build
```

> You can preview the built app with `yarn preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
