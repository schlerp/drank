		"description": [
			"The Daiquiri was supposedly invented in 1898 in the eponymous mining town of Daiquiri on the southeastern tip of Cuba by an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox. It was introduced in the United States a decade later, when a U.S. Navy medical officer brought the recipe from Cuba to Washington, D.C.",
			"This three-ingredient gift has pleased millions of palates over the ensuing years, including household names like Ernest Hemingway and President JFK. Yet no drink has suffered more abuse than the Daiquiri. In the century-plus since its inception, the granddaddy of rum cocktails has gone from the pride of Havana to an unloved extra on the back of a Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s table tent. Even today, as the craft cocktail movement reaches full tilt, most people too often associate the Daiquiri with neon-colored adult slushies, the stuff of spring-break blackouts and mind-splitting hangovers.",
			"But in its purest form, the Daiquiri is simple and sublime, a delicate blend of rum\u2019s sweetness with the raw freshness of sugar and lime juice. Whole lives have been dedicated to balancing those three elements. That each ingredient should be of the highest quality goes without saying, though even then the Daiquiri can throw you a curve. Choose an overly sweet rum or use too much sugar, and you\u2019re left sipping liquid candy; overdo the citrus, and the cocktail drowns in a puckering pool of acidity.",
			"This recipe walks the knife edge with a mix of light rum and a darker demerara sugar syrup. The two accentuate the best qualities in each other and pair perfectly with the fresh lime juice. One trick when juicing the limes: Use a hand-squeezer (or your own hands). The oils from the rind add an extra flash of intensity that gives the cocktail a nice, bright edge."

		"name": "Mojito",
		"description": [
			"The Mojito is one of the most popular rum cocktails served today, with a recipe known around the world. The origins of this classic drink can be traced to Cuba and the 16th-century cocktail El Draque. Named for Sir Francis Drake, the English sea captain and explorer who visited Havana in 1586, El Draque was composed of aguardiente (a cane-spirit precursor to rum), lime, mint and sugar. It was supposedly consumed for medicinal purposes, but it\u2019s easy to believe that drinkers enjoyed its flavor and effects.",
			"Eventually, rum replaced aguardiente and the name was changed to the Mojito. It\u2019s unclear exactly when this transpired, but the Mojito first appeared in cocktail literature in the 1932 edition of \u201cSloppy Joe\u2019s Bar Cocktail Manual, a book from the famed Havana institution.",
			"Appropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (the island nation grows sugar cane) are joined together and then lengthened with thirst-quenching club soda to create a delicious, lighthearted cocktail. The drink is traditionally made with unaged white rum, which yields a light, crisp flavor. Using Cuban rum will score you points for authenticity, although many modern Cuban rums are lighter in style than their predecessors, so you might try experimenting with white rums until you find one that you like best.",
			"The Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint, but the end result is worth the effort. The mint combines with the other ingredients for an extra dose of refreshment that, while often associated with summer, can be enjoyed any time of the year",
			"If you prefer your cocktails with a dash of literary history, you\u2019re in luck. The Mojito is said to have been a favorite of Ernest Hemingway who, according to local lore, partook of them regularly at the Havana bar La Bodeguita del Medio."

			"I asked my grandmother about Canch\u00e1nchara one day, and she laughed. \u201cCanch\u00e1nchara? No se.\u201d",
			"Canch\u00e1nchara is said to be the oldest known cocktail in Cuba, dating back to (or before) the Ten Years War in the late 19th century when Cuban guerrillas, known as mambises, began the fight against Spain for independence. It was meant to be a healing drink, equal parts practicality and magic, and most likely served warm, with ingredients from the field that were easily accessible, like sugar cane, lime and honey\u2014a Daiquiri of sorts. It was used to cure the common cold.",
			"My grandmother was pretty sheltered growing up. She left Cuba as a young wife and mom in the 1960s and never looked back. In times of illness, the answer to everything for her was (and still is) Vicks VapoRub, an American topical solution with menthol and eucalyptus. No wonder she\u2019d never heard of Canch\u00e1nchara. Most Cubans I\u2019ve mentioned it to have had a similar skeptical response.",
			"I was introduced to Canch\u00e1nchara by Natalie Beltran and Andrew Tyree, a cool L.A. couple who founded Coast to Costa, an immersive travel company that tailors in-depth group trips to countries like Peru, Mexico, Colombia and, of course, Cuba. Their Cuba trip typically begins in Old Havana but then always moves to Trinidad, for a night or two, just about a four-hour drive away.",
			"\u201cWhen bringing our group to the colonial town of Trinidad, nothing starts the visit off better than a fresh Canch\u00e1nchara. It\u2019s refreshing but packs a punch and will get you dancing in no time,\u201d says Natalie.",
			"Founded by the Spanish conquistador Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar, Trinidad prospered during the colonial period, growing rich from the labor of enslaved Africans working on sugar plantations. Wealthy European landowners built many historically preserved buildings, securing Trinidad's status as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. It\u2019s a town where most bars serve Canch\u00e1nchara, with some recipes utilizing aguardiente, or \u201cfirewater.\u201d Essentially, it\u2019s just rum in its most stripped down state\u2014sugar cane juice that has been fermented and contains anywhere from 29% to 60% alcohol by volume.",
			"\u201cI do know that the drink was pre-colonial and enjoyed by the native Taino people,\u201d says Natalie. \u201cI\u2019ve heard they used to drink it out of gourds, but there\u2019s a family of potters that now make the cups out of clay in the shape of a gourd. They are sixth-generation potters in Trinidad.\u201d",
			"The pots are referred to as copas de barro, minus the base or the stem. One man, known throughout the village as just Chichi, is a master potter who handcrafts the clay mugs with no handles and then makes and proudly serves the cocktail to guests himself. But he\u2019s not the only one. There\u2019s an entire bar in Trinidad devoted to the drink, and with a name like Taberna La Canch\u00e1nchara, it can\u2019t possibly be a bust. Plus, there\u2019s live salsa music at Taberna and almost everywhere you turn in this oft-overlooked town.",
			"I think it\u2019s important to note that creative liberties can be taken when making this cocktail, as long as it doesn\u2019t stray too far from the original and whether its sole purpose is to cure you of an ailment or get you on the dance floor."

			"It\u2019s hard to beat a Mojito in terms of pure refreshment, especially in the warmer months of the year. A tall, frosty glass of mint, lime, soda and rum, the Cuban classic has been a popular drink for decades. The Yerba Buena, an intoxicating concoction from the late chef and restaurateur Donna Scala, takes the fundamentals of the drink and adds some fresh elements\u2014reposado tequila is substituted for the rum and ginger beer steps in for the club soda, adding a peppery-sweet kick to the drink.",
			"There are a few tips to help make sure the Yerba Buena comes out perfectly. First is to exercise some restraint when muddling the mint\u2014over-muddling mint leaves and grinding them into pulp releases chlorophyll, which can give the drink some unwanted bitterness. Furthermore, the resulting leaves come apart as a stringy mess in the drink. Instead, gently press the leaves with a muddler to release their flavorful oils without pulverizing them.",
			"Another tip for building the perfect Yerba Buena is to use whole ice cubes. While it can be appealing to fill the glass with crushed ice like a Mai Tai or Mint Julep, a few larger ice cubes leads to slower dilution, which is important for a drink you can take your time with. A Julep, on the other hand, is a bold, rich drink that benefits from the dilution of crushed ice.",
			"The choice of ginger beer greatly affects the final product when making a drink like the Yerba Buena. For starters, there\u2019s a crucial distinction between ginger ale, which is a sweetened soda flavored with ginger, and ginger beer, which gets its bubbles and flavor from the natural fermentation of ginger, sugar, yeast and water. If pressed, ginger ale will get the job done, but it lacks the lively spice of ginger beer.",
			"These days there are plenty of excellent ginger beer options on the market. Fentimans sees plenty of action in cocktail bars, while Q Ginger Beer brings an extra level of spice to the mix. However, for a truly special drink (and some extra work), you can always try your hand at making your own ginger beer. A word of caution, though\u2014once you make your own, it may be hard to go back to the bottled stuff."

The drink\u2019s most distinctive feature is that eye-catching red wine float, topping what\u2019s essentially a classic\u00a0Whiskey Sour\u00a0of bourbon, lemon juice,\u00a0simple syrup\u00a0and (optionally) egg white. Over the last century, the drink\u2019s popularity has ebbed and flowed, and each time it resurfaces it often comes with a number of variations, twists and tweaks.",
			"This particular twist, the Pine Pepper Crush, comes from bartending professional Jacques Bezuidenhout, and veers quite a bit away from the classic version and into the territory of the Tommy\u2019s Margarita (a Margarita that has agave syrup rather than orange liqueur). In it, blanco tequila takes the place of the usual bourbon, lime juice replaces the lemon juice and agave syrup replaces simple syrup. It also gets sweetness and acidity from muddled pineapple and spice from cracked black pepper, both of which pair well with the tequila.",
			"Rather than the familiar red wine float used in the New York Sour, the Pine Pepper Crush gets a float of tawny Port. That gives it a similar striking visual, but mutes the tartness of the pineapple rather than enhancing it like a traditional, more acidic red wine float would. The end result is bright and juicier than your average New York Sour, but with additional complexity thanks to the pineapple, Port and pepper."

			"It\u2019s tempting to call the Rodriguez Sour a variation on the Margarita. After all, it has tequila, lime and sugar syrup. But while it wouldn\u2019t be misguided to do so, the syrup, instead of triple sec, makes this drink more akin to a variation on a Tequila Sour.",

The drink comes from bartending veteran Kevin Diedrich, from San Francisco bar Pacific Cocktail Haven. Besides the spice from the jalape\u00f1o syrup and the sweet tart flavors of pineapple, the drink features additional complexity and a pale green hue from the inclusion of green Chartreuse. This French herbal liqueur boasts a storied history and its recipe is proprietary, reportedly known only by a handful of monks. Secret recipe aside, the liqueur pairs beautifully with a number of spirits, lending its aromatic botanicals to drinks like the Last Word and the Tipperary. Tequila, in general, pairs well with the liqueur, accentuating its vegetal, grassy notes.",

But for those who love their drinks with a good deal of heat, using the whole pepper will create a rather spicy cocktail.

However, you don\u2019t need the excuse of an over-indulgent holiday to mix an Irish whiskey cocktail. Though the spirit family is less commonly used in drinks than its American counterparts like bourbon and rye, the wide-ranging world of Irish whiskey lends itself well to cocktail bartending.",
			"One such drink that serves as a fun St. Patrick\u2019s Day libation as well as a pleasing year-round beverage is the Frisky Whiskey. This Irish whiskey cocktail comes from Allen Katz, an experienced bartender and co-founder of the New York Distilling Company. The Frisky Whiskey features a number of unconventional ingredients, namely Irish whiskey, honey liqueur and orange juice rather than the more typical lemon or lime juice. This Irish sour is further sweetened with simple syrup and gets botanicals and depth from Angostura bitters.",
			"Katz does not specify a brand of Irish whiskey, and there are plenty of stellar options out there, from the more familiar like Jameson and Powers to a suite of new expressions and brands. As the whiskey is mixed with other potent ingredients, including orange juice and honey liqueur, its flavor will be muffled, so it\u2019s best to save the top-shelf labels for sipping on their own or for use in an Irish Old Fashioned.",

This German honey liqueur is related to J\u00e4germeister in name only; j\u00e4ger is \u201chunter\u201d in German, and the honey liqueur\u2019s name translates to \u201cbear hunter.\u201d Made with real honey, it also goes into drinks like the Bee Sting. However, since this is an Irish cocktail, a honey liqueur like Celtic Honey, made entirely with Irish ingredients, would be an appropriate substitute. If using that or another alternative, be sure to taste for sweetness and adjust accordingly before serving.

Luckily, bartenders and writers have developed a number of drinks that evoke the spirit of the utopian world of Star Trek. That way, you can enjoy one (or more) while watching episodes from your favorite era, whether that\u2019s the original series, \u201cThe Next Generation,\u201d \u201cDeep Space Nine\u201d or any of the later shows.",

The two together make a lush and rich base with a touch of bitterness, which feels appropriate for a Cardassian libation.",

			"If you\u2019re a history buff, you could draw a straight line connecting this drink to the first recorded definition of the cocktail category in general (circa 1806), which called for spirits, sugar, water and bitters. The Old Fashioned hits all those marks, with whiskey, sugar, water and aromatic bitters. You could also skip the history lesson and simply make the drink.

If you want to make the cocktail with more of a modern twist, opt for simple syrup. (Although what\u2019s the big rush? The Bourbon Old Fashioned isn\u2019t going anywhere.) Just know that simple syrup adds a bit more water to your drink, so you may need to adjust your ice and stirring accordingly.",

The rum melds with the juices of the meat to develop incredible flavor.\u201d According to Jones, who also has been known to serve an overproof rum-based ginger-butter sauce over salmon, cooking with rum is not unlike using it in cocktails, in terms of flavor affinities. Use white rums for a backbone of alcohol, spiced rums for blank canvases that require a hit of baking spice (such as vanilla-flavored cakes), and aged rums for anything that could benefit from subtle caramel notes (or not-so-subtle, depending on how much you use).",

			"Mezcal, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, apple cider and apple soda make the Alfie\u2019s Apple an autumnal quaffer, though one that\u2019s a bright, crisp and aromatic pleasure all year long. New York City bartender and bar consultant Tad Carducci crafted the drink with some ingredients that might be a bit difficult to find at local shops: while fresh squeezed apple cider is easy enough to find in any grocery store or bodega, this drink additionally calls for Sidral Mundet, a century-old apple-flavored soda from Mexico.",
			"Sidral Mundet can sometimes be found at Mexican markets. And, of course, these days it\u2019s possible to find just about anything online, including Mexican apple sodas. However, if don\u2019t want to pay for the shipping on a cocktail ingredient, you can replace it with something like the popular and widespread Martinelli\u2019s or another sparkling apple cider. It won\u2019t be the exact same thing as using Sidral Mundet, so check your local stores for it first.",
			"In addition to the apple flavor, mezcal gives this highball a nice smoky finish. If smoke in your glass isn\u2019t your thing, you can always choose to use a less smoky mezcal, or even swap it out for tequila. St-Germain raises the sweetness level and floral notes of the drink, and while it\u2019s the most well-known and popular brand of elderflower liqueur, there are some alternatives including Drillaud Elderflower Liqueur\u00a0and\u00a0St. Elder Elderflower Liqueur.",
			"Another area for customization is with the rim. Carducci rims his highball glass with a mix of Chinese five-spice powder and sugar for extra sweetness and spice. However, if you don\u2019t like the flavor of it, or just don\u2019t want to fuss with it, it\u2019s fine to omit. If you do want to include it, the trick is to place a small amount of the powder on a flat plate and rub a wedge of lemon around the rim of the glass, making sure not to spill down the side. Then, gently roll the rim in the powder. The moisture helps the powder cling to the glass, and the result is a clean and evenly dusted rim."

There are some alternatives, though: Wild Roots Vodka from Portland, Oregon, has a lovely pear vodka, though it lacks the spice of Hangar One\u2019s. France\u2019s Grey Goose La Poire and Skyy Vodka\u2019s Bartlett pear-infused vodka from San Francisco are both good replacements, though they similarly lack the spice element that the recipe calls for.",

			"The drink comes from Kim Haasarud, an experienced bartender with many years behind the stick who founded Liquid Architecture, a bar consultancy agency. Despite its name, the Very Sexy Martini is closer to a take on a Vodka Sour\u2014like a Cosmopolitan or a Lemon Drop\u2014than it is a Martini. A mix of muddled raspberries and mint, citrus vodka, sugar, lime juice and sparkling ros\u00e9, it\u2019s the perfect kind of drink for Valentine\u2019s Day or for anniversaries and other romantic occasions. However, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there\u2019s no need for an excuse to make yourself something that\u2019s a little sweet, a little boozy and plenty pink.",
			"There are plenty of options for citrus vodkas on the market today, including standbys like Absolut and Ketel One, as well as newer ones like Hangar One Buddha\u2019s Hand vodka from the Bay Area. Whatever you might have on hand for drinks like the Lemon Drop will suit the Very Sexy Martini well.",
			"Similarly, there\u2019s flexibility on what wine to use. Haasarud\u2019s recipe calls for a ros\u00e9 Champagne by Mo\u00ebt & Chandon, a big-name Champagne label with wide availability. Any ros\u00e9 from the Champagne region will work, as will many other sparkling ros\u00e9 wines, such as Cremant d\u2019Alsace or Cremant de Bourgogne. US states, especially along the West Coast, have their own\u2014often more affordable\u2014takes on pink bubbles. Whatever you select, make sure it\u2019s on the dry side before you add any simple syrup to the recipe, or risk an overly sweet concoction.",
			"Because the drink only calls for 1 1/2 ounces of the bubbly, it\u2019s a smart idea to make a large batch of the Very Sexy Martini. Otherwise, you run the risk of a bottle of sparkling wine going flat. Of course, the alternative is enjoying the wine on its own, maybe starting the evening with the Very Sexy Martini and pairing the leftover wine with dinner; luckily, sparkling ros\u00e9 goes with just about anything, including hard-to-pair dishes like spicy stir fries or barbecue."

			"One extremely popular variation on the Margarita is the Strawberry Basil Margarita, when the drink is enhanced with the spicy-sweet vegetal notes of basil and the fruitiness of strawberries. This bright pink libation is a signature drink of beach time fun and garden parties, especially when made properly (mainly by not using a cloying, artificial mixer in place of real fruit and fresh herbs). However, it can be punched up even more with another summertime staple: ros\u00e9. In particular, sparkling ros\u00e9.",
			"One immediate concern that can be put to rest is that adding sparkling ros\u00e9 will make the drink sweet.

			"Of course, it doesn\u2019t need to be strawberries, though they are some of the easiest to work with, and pair beautifully with the basil. Raspberries are an obvious substitution and can bring even more tartness and vivid color. Blueberries make for a fun, darker drink and still work well with sparkling ros\u00e9. Even tropical fruits like star fruit and mango will work well provided they are in season. Just be sure to taste for sweetness and adjust accordingly, remembering that while you can always add sugar (in this case, in the form of agave syrup), it\u2019s much trickier to take it out.",

		"description": [
			"With elderflower, Fuji apple, rye whiskey and champagne, the Summer Rye is an appropriately named cocktail. However, this drink from bartender and brand educator Willy Shine is just as good in fall, winter and spring as it is in the summer months.",
			"Shine opts for Sazerac rye whiskey as the base of the Summer Rye; this historic rye brand from New Orleans is made at Buffalo Trace distillery, and has its own unique rye profile with bold, spicy rye notes and a somewhat subdued alcohol level. Generally retailing around $30 for a 750-milliliter bottle, it\u2019s a great whiskey for the price point, enjoyable in cocktails like the Summer Rye as well as on its own; given its name and heritage, it\u2019s no surprise that it makes an excellent Sazerac. However, if you\u2019ve got another rye at home or a personal favorite, feel free to substitute.",
			"Rather than relying only on simple syrup for sweetness, Shine uses St-Germain elderflower liqueur. This floral and fruity liqueur was so ubiquitous in the early days of the so-called Cocktail Renaissance in the mid-to-late 2000s that it was given the moniker \u201cBartender\u2019s Ketchup.\u201d However, it\u2019s no after-thought in the Summer Rye, with its notes of white flowers evoking the breeze of a summer\u2019s day, especially when paired with apple. While a commonplace liqueur on bar shelves, it now has a few marketplace competitors, including Drillaurd and St Elder.",
			"More specific is the apple juice used: rather than any store-bought apple cider, the Summer Rye calls for fresh-pressed Fuji apple juice. Though its origins are in Japan, its popularity sees it in markets across the world, including the U.S. Despite the drink\u2019s name, finding fresh apple juice is easiest in fall, especially at farmers markets and apple orchards. Otherwise, substituting another kind of fresh apple juice is acceptable in a pinch.",
			"Finally, the drink is topped with champagne. The recipe calls for only 3/4 an ounce of champagne, which means opening a full bottle of expensive French bubbly for just a few drinks leaves you with a lot of extra wine. While that\u2019s certainly not the worst problem to have, it can be a bit pricey; feel free to replace the wine with something more affordable. Cava, for instance, often has notes of citrus and apple that would pair well with the rest of the drink."

			"Named for the color of the moon during an eclipse, this drink comes from The NoMad in New York City. Besides being bright and fruity, the Eclipse provides a lovely introduction to Aperol and shows how well the Italian aperitivo can play with agave spirits like tequila and mezcal.",
			"Aperol is lighter, brighter and more citrus-forward than its big brother Campari. Once relatively obscure in the United States it has boomed in popularity in recent years due to the proliferation of the Aperol Spritz, with the bubbly quaffer now an essential item for afternoon drinking. However the liqueur is far more versatile than being relegated solely to spritzes, and it pairs well with tequila, bringing out some of the natural fruity notes from the agave spirit. While you could potentially substitute Campari or another bitter red liqueur in the Eclipse, it won\u2019t translate precisely.",
			"The inclusion of Heering cherry liqueur adds depth, a strong backbone and a touch of sweetness to the drink. There are other cherry liqueurs on the market, most famously Luxardo maraschino liqueur, but those are generally sweeter than Heering. Along with the earthy tequila, the bittersweet Aperol and tart lemon juice, the drink is an exercise in balance. The mezcal float brings a touch of smoke to the party, with the final product being complex and layered.",
			"Using the proper ice, as in any drink, is a crucial part of building the Eclipse. Larger ice cubes, like the two-inch by two-inch cube that the recipe calls for, slow dilution in the drink, maintaining its deep flavors until the last dram. If necessary, regular ice cubes from the freezer can do the job, but those looking for the full experience should consider investing in some larger ice cube trays. While not essential for making drinks like the Old Fashioned, they will improve them.",
			"The large cube also provides a better surface on which to float the mezcal. However, unlike drinks that feature something like a float of dark rum for contrast, the mezcal float isn\u2019t as necessary to get perfect, as its light color blends imperceptibly with the drink. Its purpose, instead, is to provide some extra smoky richness with the first few sips. After a brief time it should blend into the rest of the drink."

			"The bright and sweet Pimm\u2019s Cup is a consummate summertime libation, the sort of thing best enjoyed in a garden or on a plant-lined patio. This playful variation from bartender H. Joseph Ehrmann, owner of Elixir Saloon in San Fransisco, doubles down on the vegetal quality of the drink with the addition of celery, cilantro and cucumber, muddling them into the drink rather than leaving them as a garnish.",
			"The Celery Cup No. 1 relies on the quality and freshness of the produce used. Erhmann advises using a celery piece closest to the heart, where it\u2019s sweetest. Using one of the larger, thicker outer stems can lead to a bitter, spicier drink. He also includes cilantro, which can taste soapy to some palates; there\u2019s no real substitution for it, so if you\u2019re making this for someone who doesn\u2019t care for cilantro it\u2019s best to omit it.",
			"Along with an English cucumber\u2014which is thinner and sweeter than the more traditional slicer cucumbers found at grocery stores\u2014Erhmann uses cucumber vodka from Square One, a distillery in the Bay Area. Though the organic vodka is a solid option\u2014and nearby to Erhmann\u2019s historic bar\u2014there are substitutions available. Prairie Organic, from Minnesota, makes a cucumber vodka and has the benefit of also being organic. Effen Vodka, from Holland, produces a fine cucumber vodka, and Plume and Petal\u2019s cucumber-flavored vodka is only 40-proof, or 20% alcohol, for those who want a lower proof Celery Cup.",
			"Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Pimm\u2019s Cup variation without the namesake liqueur. However, with only 1/2 ounce of it in the drink, the Pimm\u2019s No. 1 plays more of a support role in the Celery Cup No. 1, leading to a brighter, lighter drink. Most of the sweetness comes from the agave nectar, so those who like their cocktails dry and crisp can cut back on that.

			"Elderflower liqueur and sparkling wine have long been a celebrated combination. The sweetness and floral aspect of the liqueur are beautifully highlighted by a dry, bubbly wine like cava or Champagne. The simplest take on this is the St-Germain Cocktail, a spritz made with the eponymous elderflower liqueur, club soda and white wine, and the Elderflower Fizz builds on that basic formula. The drink comes from bartender Trudy Thomas, who created it while at the Camelback Inn Resort & Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona. In it, St-Germain elderflower liqueur is joined by vodka, agave nectar and lime and is topped with sparkling wine.",
			"St-Germain largely started the elderflower liqueur craze in the early part of the \u201cCocktail Renaissance\u201d when it was introduced in 2007. It was jokingly referred to as \u201cthe bartender\u2019s ketchup,\u201d as the elegant bottles were found at cocktail bars across the country. Today, it\u2019s not quite so ubiquitous, but still regularly found on cocktail menus. Furthermore, St-Germaine has been joined by a number of other elderflower spirits, including the French Drillaud Elderflower Liqueur and the U.S. crafted St. Elder Elderflower Liqueur. While the Elderflower Fizz specifically calls for the original, you can substitute others to your tastes and preference.",
			"The Elderflower Fizz calls for using Gruet sparkling wine as its bubbly. The New Mexico winery is well known for its affordable, Champagne-style wines. The Brut is a solid choice for this cocktail, as the dry, sparkling wine is an excellent value for using in cocktails. For even more depth, though, the Blanc de Blanc offers an elegant and robust flavor profile for only a little more expense. Gruet ros\u00e9, while lovely, should be avoided to maintain the clarity of the drink\u2019s color.",

			"The Margarita is one of the most popular and versatile drinks in bartending. While the base recipe is pretty unimpeachable, it lends itself to all kinds of twists and additions. For instance, fruits like strawberry, pineapple and watermelon are all common ingredients to include in a Margarita, as are peppers, especially the jalapeno. Bell peppers, on the other hand, are far less prevalent, but that\u2019s exactly what the Savory Margarita, from bartending icon Charlotte Voisey, uses. In her take on the drink, fresh red bell pepper juice adds a savory, zesty kick that is balanced with honey syrup and enlivened with fresh cilantro.",
			"If you have a juicer, the fresh red bell pepper juice is easy to make. Add three to four bell peppers into the juicer and be greeted with some fresh, zesty juice. If you don\u2019t have one available, an ordinary blender can do the trick. Seed and dice the peppers before adding them to the blender and pulse until liquified; you may need to add some water if it\u2019s too thick. After blending, strain through a fine mesh sieve or cheese cloth into a clean glass jar and store for up to a week in the refrigerator. You can swap some or all of the red peppers for yellow or orange ones, but keep in mind that it will affect the sweetness of the drink, as well as its ruby hue. Green pepper will throw the flavor off greatly.",
			"In addition to the savory qualities from the bell pepper juice, the Savory Margarita also gets some vegetal notes from a handful of cilantro. If you\u2019re making the drink for someone who tastes soap whenever they eat cilantro, you\u2019ll want to omit it entirely, as substitutions don\u2019t really work for the herb."

			"As Italian liqueurs go, amaretto might be the most misunderstood. When joined with commercial sour mix, it becomes the backbone to a two-ingredient sugar bomb with a hangover to match. While the original recipe was flavored with bitter almonds, they were abandoned when producers realized they were potentially chock-full of deadly cyanide. Modern versions instead use regular almonds or apricot or peach stones to capture that distinctive flavor.",
			"But how can we flip amaretto\u2019s stereotype as cloyingly sweet? And what else can we do with that bottle in the far reaches of our liquor collection? The Spiced Margarita from Joan Villanueva, the beverage curator at\u00a0BO-beau kitchen + cach\u00e9\u00a0in San Diego, is one such answer. In this Margarita variation, amaretto stands in for the sweetness normally provided by orange liqueur or simple syrup, and muddled jalape\u00f1o slices lend a touch of lip-tingling heat. \u201cSpicy and bold flavors work really well with amaretto,\u201d Villanueva says. \u201cI sometimes hear how people drank too much amaretto a long time ago, so I like to offer the option to reconnect with an old friend.\u201d",
			"Though the recipe calls for a blanco tequila as its base, Vllanueva says that mezcal drinks\u00a0with a chile-heat component are her go-to inspirations for incorporating amaretto. Substituting the tequila with mezcal is a popular approach to making Margaritas in general, and it definitely works here as well, with the smoky, earthy spirit blending with the rich sweetness of amaretto and fiery kick of peppers.",
			"If you\u2019re opting for the original recipe with blanco tequila, though, you\u2019ve got many, many options. It\u2019s best to find a tequila that fits your budget and tastes and keep it on hand for Margaritas like this one, so you\u2019ll never have to debate what to use."

Others say that the Margarita, which translates to daisy flower in Spanish, was an inevitable twist on the Daisy, a cocktail template involving spirit, citrus, orange liqueur and soda. Make one with tequila, leave out the soda, and you get a Margarita. But regardless of how or when it was invented, the Margarita has earned its way into drinkers\u2019 hearts.",
			"When choosing your tequila, quality is key. Opt for a blanco made from 100% blue agave. If it doesn\u2019t say this on the label, it\u2019s mixto\u2014a tequila composed of up to 49% mystery sugars. And although many people reach for premade sour mix, using fresh lime juice will result in a vastly superior drink. Then there\u2019s the orange liqueur. What is a mandatory ingredient for some is rendered optional by others, who replace the sweetener with agave syrup. Go that route, and you get the Tommy\u2019s Margarita, which was created in the early \u201990s at Tommy\u2019s Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco.",

			"The Coffee Cocktail is a historic drink that likely originated in New Orleans alongside other iconic concoctions like the Sazerac and Vieux Carr\u00e9. But what is perhaps surprising about the Coffee Cocktail is the glaring omission of anything caffeinated\u2014there\u2019s no coffee in this delicious libation. Furthermore, early transcribers of the drink described the name as a misnomer for also lacking bitters, an essential ingredient in anything originally called a \u201ccocktail.\u201d",

The result was a drink that vaguely resembled coffee with cream, the probable origin of its name. However, in this version from Jack McGarry of New York\u2019s legendary Irish Bar the Dead Rabbit, the drink gets a makeover with Irish whiskey standing in for brandy and the addition of Irish cream liqueur. Like the original recipe, the spirits are in equal parts.",

However, when making the recipe, the quality of each ingredient is more important than getting the specific brand right. Bailey\u2019s is an acceptable substitution for the Irish cream, or you can even try your hand at making your own. Instead of the Clontarf\u2014a quality and affordable Irish whiskey\u2014you could use something like Powers, Knappogue Castle, Tullamore D.E.W., or even Jameson or Bushmills. The Port, similarly, can be replaced with another as long as you stick to a late-bottled vintage Port to maintain the flavor profile. And, unlike the original recipe, the Dead Rabbit version does have bitters.

Legend has it that when he first served it and was asked if it was Brazilian coffee, Sheridan cheekily replied that it was \u201cIrish coffee.\u201d",

After tasting one in Ireland, he and the bar\u2019s owner, Jack Koeppler, attempted to recreate the warming elixir. They succeeded, and Deplante wrote about the drink in his column, which was read widely across the States. This helped to earn the drink a following at Buena Vista and beyond. On a busy day, the San Francisco bar can serve more than 2,000 Irish Coffees. With its comforting blend of whiskey, caffeine and cream, it\u2019s easy to see the drink\u2019s appeal.",
			"According to bartending legend Dale DeGroff, the Irish Coffee should not be a large drink. He says that bars, particularly in America, go too big, which ruins the balance of an otherwise great cocktail. \"Choose the vessel wisely,\" he says. \"The small bell-shaped glass that Libbey has been providing to The Buena Vista for decades is a nice size at six ounces.\"",
			"Then you can build your drink right in the glass, starting with the whiskey, sugar and coffee, and topping it with a dose of thick cream. \"At The Buena Vista Cafe, the concoction is finished with a white cloud of hand-whipped cream,\" says DeGroff. \"This topping serves two important purposes: It creates the drink\u2019s signature dramatic black-and-white look, and the unsweetened coolness of the cream tempers the alcohol and the hot, sugary coffee.\" If you\u2019d like to decorate that gorgeous white head, you can optionally add a dusting of fresh cinnamon or nutmeg for a fragrant garnish.",
			"\"You also don\u2019t need a giant pour of Irish whiskey,\" says DeGroff. \"Delaplane and Koeppler\u2019s recipe calls for a one-ounce shot. I know it seems stingy, but do not be put off\u2014it\u2019s actually good news. That liquor, along with three-and-a-half ounces of steaming-hot sweetened coffee and three-quarters of an inch of lightly whipped cream, is so delicious you\u2019ll want to consume at least two more.\" Liquor.com\u2019s recipe below calls for slightly more than that, but it's still not enough to knock you off your bar stool.",

			"2. Top with no more than four ounces of steaming-hot sweetened coffee.",

			"Spirit, citrus and sugar\u2014the original big three\u2014combine to form the classic sour, one of the oldest types of cocktails. The category includes the Whiskey Sour, which has sated thirsty drinkers for more than one and a half centuries. It\u2019s unknown exactly when the cocktail was conceived (or who was the architect), but its history stretches back to the Lincoln administration, and the first printed recipe appeared circa 1862 in the famed \u201cJerry Thomas Bartenders Guide.\u201d",
			"The Whiskey Sour was traditionally made with whiskey, lemon juice, sugar and egg white, an ingredient that tames the tart flavor and creates a richer, smoother texture. Today that egg is optional, and it\u2019s common to find bars serving Whiskey Sours without egg white. But if you want to taste the original incarnation of the drink, and put a little protein in your system, give it a try. When using egg white, you\u2019ll want to perform a \u201cdry shake\u201d and shake all the ingredients without ice before shaking again with fresh ice. This pro move incorporates the ingredients together into one cohesive package.",
			"Few drinks in the cocktail canon are as quick to satisfy as a silky sour. But like most classic cocktails, the Whiskey Sour has spawned countless variations, from tried-and-true riffs like the red wine-topped New York Sour to versions incorporating other fruits, juices and sweeteners. Add a flourish to any component, and you have a personal spin on this classic refreshment.",
			"We like our Whiskey Sour spiked with bourbon, thickened with egg white and topped with a few dashes of aromatic bitters for a complementary spice note. Follow that format, and you can\u2019t go wrong. But one of the best things about the sour is that it\u2019s customizable, so you do you."

			"The Whiskey Sour is a gold standard of sours\u2014a sweet, tart, and boozy mixture of whiskey, lemon juice and simple syrup. However, one way to add an additional complexity and a striking visual appeal to the drink is to make it a New York Sour. This century-plus old variation on the traditional sour is a simple one: the drink is finished with a crimson float of red wine.",
			"That\u2019s how bartender Kenneth McCoy made the standard of Whiskey Sour at New York City\u2019s now-shuttered Ward III. McCoy was using Heaven Hill bourbon, a bottled-in-bond bourbon from Bardstown, Kentucky. McCoy found that the soft caramel notes of Heaven Hill bourbon could handle a little extra tartness, so he adjusted the normal proportions in the drink from equal parts citrus and simple syrup to a bit heavy on the lemon side. And, as with a New York Sour, he added a red wine float using chianti, a relatively high-acid red wine.",
			"The balance in this drink is also helped by the inclusion of egg whites. Beyond giving the drink a beautiful layer of foam\u2014which is created in part by dry shaking the drink with no ice before shaking again with ice\u2014egg whites also add richness and a silky mouthfeel that can smooth out some of the sharper, more acerbic edges of the citrus juice and tart red wine.",
			"To really step up the visuals of the drink, it\u2019s possible to pour the red wine carefully down the back of a bar spoon whose tip is just under the layer of egg white foam. When poured, it should settle and float under the foam, creating a vivid red band between the lush brown drink and the white foam. Don\u2019t get discouraged if it doesn\u2019t come out right the first time. As with any bartending trick, it can take many tries to get down.

He suggests using Beefeater, a classic London dry gin, and Noilly Prat, a good dry vermouth from France. That combination in a three-to-one ratio, with an olive for garnish, will help you channel the intrepid duo as you stir then sip your cocktail.",
			"One noteworthy aside: In \u201cThe Thin Man,\u201d Nick and Nora shake their Martinis. Nick even instructs a bartender that, \u201cThe important thing is the rhythm.\u00a0Always\u00a0have rhythm in your\u00a0shaking. Now a Manhattan\u00a0you shake\u00a0to fox-trot\u00a0time, a Bronx to two-step\u00a0time, a\u00a0Dry Martini you always shake to waltz time.\u201d That certainly provides good reading, but DeGroff follows the preferred path for cocktails composed entirely of spirits, opting to stir the drink, which produces a clear, silky cocktail free of ice shards.",
			"In addition to their eponymous cocktail, Nick and Nora\u2019s enduring impact on cocktail culture also inspired the proliferation of the Nick & Nora glass, a stemmed, slightly rounded cocktail glass that lands somewhere between a traditional Martini glass and a coupe. In the movie, the duo drank regularly from this modestly sized glass (which is good, because on one occasion they each downed six Martinis), which helped to popularize it at bars and among the public. You will still find the glass in use today, particularly at your better cocktail bars. Its attractive shape and reasonable volume provide a great vessel for craft drinks."

			"There are limitless ways to tweak the classic Martini, from tried-and-true iterations like the 50/50 and Dirty Martini to suspect \u2019Tinis that combine a spirit with sugary mixers in a stemmed glass. But one of the best variations is also the easiest to make, simply calling for a specific garnish to differentiate it from all other Martinis.",
			"The Gibson is made with gin and dry vermouth and garnished with a pickled onion\u2014not an olive, nor a lemon twist. It\u2019s only a Gibson when that savory onion adorns the glass, adding its umami undertone to the classic cocktail.",
			"The origin behind this drink isn\u2019t entirely clear, but it\u2019s possible that the Gibson was created by San Francisco businessman Walter D.K. Gibson in the late 1800s at the Bohemian Club. The Gibson did first appear in print in the 1908 book,\u00a0\u201cThe World\u2019s Drinks And How To Mix Them\u201d by William Boothby. But then, the Gibson was more known for what it omitted than what it added. During that time, it was customary to add a dash or two of bitters to a Martini. The Gibson was made without bitters, and the necessary onion wasn\u2019t strictly associated with the drink until years later.",
			"Gin is the traditional choice when making Gibsons, but as vodka usurped the gin\u2019s botanical throne through the decades, vodka-laced Gibsons became common. You can choose whichever spirit you prefer. The dry, bracing gin lends more of its own character to the cocktail, while milder vodka takes a back seat to the other components.",
			"One way to really customize this three-part drink is by making your own pickled onions. A common practice in cocktail bars, it\u2019s an easy endeavor. Most recipes simply call for soaking or cooking a handful of cocktail onions in a brine of vinegar, sugar and pickling spices. Making your own onions ensures that your Gibson\u2019s garnish is fresh and crunchy, imbuing the drink with depth and complexity rather than the artificial sweetness often associated with the jarred versions. Once your onions are done, all you need is gin and dry vermouth, and you\u2019re ready to enjoy this underrated classic."

			"The legendary Cosmopolitan is a simple cocktail with a big history. It reached its height of popularity in the 1990s, when the HBO show \u201cSex and the City\u201d was at its peak. The pink-hued, Martini-style drink was a favorite of the characters on the show. It made its debut during the second season and became a series regular after that.",
			"For a good decade, the Cosmopolitan may have been the most popular cocktail in America, and bartenders couldn\u2019t work a shift without making dozens of them for thirsty patrons. Naturally, its ubiquity spurred countless riffs, from the White Cosmo (St-Germain in place of Cointreau) to versions featuring gin. While the drink isn\u2019t as popular today as it was in its heyday, the classic recipe is still very much alive.",
			"According to bartending legend and author Gary Regan, the original Cosmopolitan was created in 1985 by Miami bartender Cheryl Cook while working at a South Beach bar called the Strand. Eager to invent a new cocktail for the Martini glass, Cook riffed on the classic Kamikaze by using a newly introduced citrus-flavored vodka, plus a splash of cranberry juice.",
			"There\u2019s some debate about who created the original Cosmopolitan. Many believe, like Regan, that it was first mixed by Cook. Others believe that Dale DeGroff concocted it at New York City\u2019s Rainbow Room, or that Toby Cecchini first devised a Cosmo in 1988 during his tenure at New York\u2019s Odeon. However, all agree that Cecchini popularized the vodka-and-cranberry \u2019Tini. His version of the drink called for 2 ounces of Absolut Citron vodka, an ounce of Cointreau, an ounce of Ocean Spray cranberry juice cocktail and an ounce of fresh lime juice, with a lemon twist.",
			"The Cosmo was a product of its time. In the late-1980s and early-\u201990s, vodka was king, but flavored vodka was just finding an audience. When Absolut released its first flavored vodka, the lemony Citron, bartenders had a new toy to work with. Cecchini used it in the Cosmo alongside Ocean Spray, and the vodka-and-cranberry duo is still the preferred pair at most bars today. You, of course, can use whichever citrus-flavored vodka and cranberry juice you like. Just remember: Don\u2019t drown your drink in cranberry. Other cocktails like the Sea Breeze call for a heavier measure of cranberry, but here the juice is meant to be only an accent, adding a touch of tartness and color."

However, its notes pair beautifully with both sparkling wine and with gin. The answer, then, lay in swapping out the traditional sparkling white wine for something darker: lambrusco, the sparkling red wine from Italy. \u201cThe earthiness of lambrusco and gin botanicals work great with the violet floral notes,\u201d Grimm says.",

Though the cocktail is a little busy with seven ingredients, they\u2019re fairly common ones that can find their way into other drinks.",

While it bears many similarities to London dry gins like Tanqueray, Beefeater or Bombay Sapphire, there are a few differences. Plymouth gin is less juniper-forward and also includes botanicals such as coriander, cardamom and angelica root, all of which give it an earthier tone. This distinction is important to the Fleur de Paradis, as swapping the gin for a more traditional London dry style will cause it to be a touch more bitter.",

			"The Ti\u2019 Punch is the national cocktail of Martinique and features just three ingredients: rhum agricole, sugar and lime. Rhum agricole is the French term for rum made from fresh sugarcane juice rather than molasses, and the style is native to French Caribbean islands, including Martinique and Guadalupe. It\u2019s a necessary component in the cocktail, as a true Ti\u2019 Punch can\u2019t be made without it. But bartenders have still been able to create their own takes on the classic recipe by incorporating different syrups, fruits and liqueurs.",
			"One such example comes from Nick Detrich of Cane & Table in New Orleans. His Coffee & Ti\u2019 takes two liberties with the original recipe: It calls for a 10-year-old rhum agricole (the classic usually features unaged spirit) and adds coffee amaro to the mix.",
			"The aged rhum agricole lends a richer and deeper flavor to the drink, plus notes of cinnamon and vanilla, while still showcasing fresh sugarcane. And the coffee amaro, which comes from Kansas City, has a bittersweet, herbal profile with notes of cardamom, gentian, orange peel and star anise. Put it all together, and you\u2019ve got a unique Ti\u2019 Punch\u2014not as bright and sugarcane-forward than the original, but still featuring rhum agricole as the star of the show.",

That can feel unusual for drinkers who are accustomed to cold cocktails, but it\u2019s a traditional practice in the French Caribbean. The ingredients are flavorful and merge together with harmony, so ice or not, the resulting cocktail is a true treat."

Often served hot (like the beloved Toddy), though not always, the drinks are strong and intense, usually something bracing and invigorating after a day on the slopes. However, according to Jimmy Yeager\u2014the owner of Jimmy\u2019s An American Restaurant and Bar in the ski-obsessed city of Aspen, Colorado\u2014their popularity has waned recently. \u201cThe days of apr\u00e8s everywhere are over compared to 20 to 30 years ago,\u201d he says, explaining that high-speed lifts and other technologies have shortened the ski day, causing skiers to wrap up on the mountain earlier.",
			"Still, there\u2019s plenty of room for some delicious, spirit-forward, botanical drinks after finishing a day of skiing. Yeager\u2019s favorite apr\u00e8s cocktail is the Flinn\u2019s Apr\u00e8s Steazy.

In particular, it calls for Lucano amaro\u2014more than a century old, this Italian liqueur is a blend of 30-plus herbs and other botanicals. The cocktail is also bolstered with rye whiskey, and Pomeroy uses one from Woody Creek, a distillery in Basalt, Colorado, only 20 miles from Aspen. For those who can\u2019t get their hands on a bottle, another American rye whiskey will fill in nicely.",
			"While the base is already an amaro, Pomeroy adds another to the mix, the famed bittersweet Italian liqueur Campari, which adds additional herbal notes to the drink. Its bitterness is balanced by St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and lemon juice brightens all of it, leading to a strong but balanced cocktail. \u201cI chose it because it\u2019s delicious and balanced,\u201d says Yeager. \u201cThe amaro is fortified by the rye whiskey and balanced by the bitter and sweet of the Campari and St-Germain.\u201d"

It\u2019s rich and complex, despite its clear color, and makes a great base in cocktails. From there, he enlists Cl\u00e9ment Creole shrubb, fresh lime juice, Martinique sugar cane syrup, aromatic bitters and orange bitters.",

It\u2019s richer, spicier and more complex than many other orange liqueurs on the market, so it does particularly magical things in cocktails, especially those made with rum.",

If you can\u2019t find this particular sweetener, you can always use simple syrup, which is easy to make at home by combining equal parts sugar and water.",

		"description": [
			"The Mai Tai is the quintessential torch bearer of Tiki, and its flagship drink. It made its flowery foray into American culture between the 1930s and 1950s, thanks to tropical-minded entrepreneurs like Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt (a.k.a. Donn Beach) and Victor Jules Bergeron (a.k.a. Trader Vic). Then, it suffered some ill use in the 1980s and 1990s, which saw its once pristine amalgamation of rums, orange liqueur, lime juice, orgeat and simple syrup befouled by the inclusion of fruit juices and artificial sweeteners. Luckily, the later part of the 2000s saw a Tiki revival that restored the cocktail to its once noble heights.",
			"This classic recipe comes from Tiki historian Jeff \u201cBeachbum\u201d Berry, the owner of New Orleans\u2019 ode to Tikidom, Latitude 29. The recipe isn\u2019t so much a variation on the drink as it is a faithful recreation of an original recipe\u2014but what is specified are the rums used in Berry\u2019s version. While both popular brands, it is possible to be in a market where you can\u2019t find the Coruba dark Jamaican rum or the Rhum Cl\u00e9ment V.S.O.P. In this case, the best move is to find a close approximation of each, like another dark Jamaican rum to fill in for the Coruba.",
			"Rhum agricole, the Rhum Cl\u00e9ment in Berry\u2019s recipe, is a type of rum that is made with sugar cane rather than molasses. This gives the spirit bright, floral and sometimes grassy or vegetal notes. The vieux in the name refers to the fact that the rum is aged for at least three years, so if you are going for a different rhum agricole, make sure it\u2019s an aged one to best replicate the Latitude 29 Mai Tai.",
			"Another aspect of this particular version of the timeless drink is the use of the Latitude 29 Formula orgeat made by Orgeat Works, a company specializing in bar syrups for Tiki craft. Founder Adam Kolesar worked with Berry to craft an orgeat that was specifically designed for Latitude\u2019s Mai Tais, and is a close approximation of the syrup Trader Vic would have been using in 1944. It\u2019s available for sale online for all your Mai Tai needs."

			"It might not be as iconic as the Mai Tai, nor as potent and indulgent as the Zombie, but the Three Dots & a Dash is as essential to Tiki bartending as any other rum-, syrup- and juice-filled concoction. Donn Beach himself, one of the two grandfathers of the Tiki movement, crafted this drink during World War II. Its name refers to the morse code for the letter V, or Victor; more meaningfully, though, it stood for \u201cvictory\u201d for the Allies in their fight against the Axis.",
			"Like many other Tiki drinks, the exact recipe has been altered and adapted over the years. This version comes from Martin Cate, owner of San Francisco\u2019s famed Tiki bar Smuggler\u2019s Cove and all around Tiki expert. Also like many other Tiki drinks, this one uses a mix of rums, starting with rhum agricole. Specifically, Cate uses AOC Martinique rhum agricole vieux at Smuggler\u2019s Cove, which is darker than many other rhum agricoles. A blended, aged rum also goes in the drink, the specifics of which are flexible.",
			"For the syrups, it\u2019s a blend of St. Elizabeth allspice dram for complexity and baking spice notes, John D. Taylor\u2019s Velvet Falernum for rich nuttiness and honey syrup for sweetness. It also gets lime and orange juice, with Angostura bitters rounding out the ingredients.",
			"One element of the drink that Cate is very specific about is the way it\u2019s made, with a process referred to as \u201cflash blending.\u201d This entails using a stand-up blender, similar to a milkshake blender, and filling the mixing vessel with crushed ice and a few larger ice cubes called \u201cagitator cubes.\u201d It\u2019s then quickly blended and the entire contents are poured into a glass, save for some of the larger chunks which are strained out. Those making this at home without the luxury of the particular kind of blender can shake the contents of the drink and strain it over crushed ice, or use a regular blender, briefly pulsing the drink with ice cubes until the desired consistency is achieved.",
			"Of course, as with any respectable Tiki drink, the garnish plays a major role. But unlike many others, this one is a bit complex: three cherries on a pick, which represent the three Morse code dots, and either a pineapple chunk or a pineapple frond that represents the dash. When selecting the maraschino cherries that top the drink, be sure to grab ones of decent quality like Luxardo\u2019s cherries. This is not the time or place for using the familiar electric-red, artificially sweetened and preserved maraschino cherries from the Shirley Temples and ice cream sundaes of yore."

This tracks, considering the cocktail contains falernum, and the most prolific falernum brand belongs to John D.\u00a0Taylor, a company that also hails from the island nation. This falernum is sweet, spicy and nutty, lending flavor and texture to many Tiki drinks. It plays the same role in the Corn \u2019n\u2019 Oil, where its almond notes complement the rich rum and tart lime.",
			"Most Corn \u2019n\u2019 Oil recipes call for blackstrap rum (or black rum), a controversial style that is characterized more by its inky black color than by any actual regulations or rules. The category generally features young distillates that get their hue from caramel coloring, not lengthy barrel aging. But those rums can be intensely flavorful and fun to work with.",
			"If you want a molasses-heavy drink full of rich sweetness, blackstrap rum is a fine choice. However, if you want to lighten the cocktail, you can replace the blackstrap rum with an aged rum, ideally one from Barbados. In this case, many bartenders dial back the lime juice or remove it entirely, allowing the Bajan rum and falernum to shine, rounded by a touch of complexity and structure provided by the aromatic bitters.",

			"The popular cocktail can be found all over the world, from craft cocktail bars and chain restaurants to island hideaways. Its origin, like many drinks, is a bit hazy, though it\u2019s likely that rum and ginger beer were first combined by sailors who enjoyed the obvious benefits of rum and the stomach-settling qualities of ginger. But its lineage can be traced squarely to an island in the Atlantic Ocean.",
			"Gosling\u2019s Black Seal rum is a rich, flavorful rum from Bermuda, dating back to 1806. It features notes of caramel, vanilla and spice, and technically, it\u2019s the only rum that can be used in a Dark \u2019n Stormy. The brand lays claim to the drink; in 1991, it successfully registered a trademark dictating that any drink titled Dark \u2019n Stormy must be made with Gosling's rum. The company has even sued other beverage brands that have attempted to peddle the drink with other rums as its star. So, if you really want the full Dark \u2019n Stormy experience, make it with Gosling\u2019s.",

If you try making your Dark \u2019n Stormy with ginger ale, you\u2019ll still produce a solid drink. But the rich rum benefits from the stronger flavors and spicier bite of real ginger beer.",
			"Many recipes, including this one, call for a modest measure of lime juice to be added to the rum and ginger beer, which lends a pleasant kick of citrus. But the lime juice is optional. If you\u2019re drinking in Bermuda, the cocktail will most likely be served with just rum and ginger beer, plus a lime wedge, so the drinker can squeeze the lime at their discretion.

The celery mix is shaken with pineapple-infused gin, cucumber bitters and Greek yogurt, which does the emulsive work of egg whites but adds a tangier kick. \u201cIt takes a bit of convincing, because people are thrown off when they see all those ingredients in the same sentence,\u201d says bar manager James Cramer. \u201cBut they come together in a way that\u2019s bigger than the sum of its parts.\u201d",

Instead, Bullock\u2019s Celery Sour called for just shaved ice and one spoonful each of lemon juice, pineapple syrup and celery bitters, stirred and strained into a \u201cfancy wine glass\u201d with fruit. Biltong Bar\u2019s evolved version is perhaps proof of how far the bar trade has come over time."

			"While the Cosmopolitan is a perfectly pleasing drink, it\u2019s also very much an artifact of its time. In the 1980s and 1990s, vodka reigned supreme amongst spirits, even in cocktail bars. However, go back a few decades to the end of Prohibition and the second age of cocktail invention, and you\u2019ll not see much in the way of vodka drinks (vodka would take off a few years later with the creation of the Moscow Mule in 1941). What was a popular spirit in the latter part of the 1930s was gin. From the Martini to the Martinez, this juniper-centric infused spirit was very much in vogue. So when Naren Young\u2014founder of Bartender magazine and the creative director at New York City bar Dante when it won the top spot from the World\u2019s 50 Best Bars\u2014put his 1930s spin on the 1980s classic, he switched out the citrus vodka for gin. He specifically uses Nolet\u2019s silver gin, a fruit and floral-forward Dutch gin rather than the more commonplace London Dry.",
			"Cointreau sticks around in the drink, but lemon juice replaces the lime for a touch more sweetness. Most importantly, though, is the swapping of a homemade raspberry syrup for the cranberry juice that gives the drink its signature pink flush. Like changing vodka for gin, it encompasses the earlier era better, as cranberry juice in drinks wasn\u2019t much of a trend until after the 1960s, when a collective of cranberry growers called Ocean Spray started publishing recipe booklets that included cranberry juice. The raspberry syrup gives the drink a gentle sweetness and fruitiness without overpowering it. It\u2019s also useful for making the Clover Club, a close relative of the Cosmopolitan 1934."

			"It doesn\u2019t get much simpler or more refreshing than the classic Gimlet. Composed of gin, fresh lime juice and sugar, the cocktail is classified as a gin sour, putting it in great company with other tried-and-true drinks. Drinks like the Daiquiri, which is a rum sour.",
			"The Gimlet\u2019s origin isn\u2019t clear, but it\u2019s believed to have been invented out of necessity by British sailors in the late 18th century. Sailors, as the story goes, needed the citrus to prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. The best way to get sailors to drink lime juice? Mix it with liquor, of course. It didn\u2019t take long to realize that this preventative drink was also delicious. So, while scurvy may be a thing of the past, the Gimlet is here to stay.",
			"The drink eventually made its way into cocktail books\u2014including the classic 1930 tome \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book\u201d by Harry Craddock\u2014with varying recipes, ingredients and proportions. Today, fresh lime juice is the preferred choice, but for decades the Gimlet was predominately made with Rose\u2019s lime cordial, a bottled mixture of lime juice and sugar that debuted in the 1860s. If using Rose\u2019s in your drink, you can skip the simple syrup, because the cordial is already sweetened. Aim for one ounce of Rose\u2019s to achieve the desired balance.",
			"The Gimlet can also be made with vodka. This practice was particularly common during the 1980s and 1990s. But as gin regained its foothold with drinkers, gin retook its rightful place in the Gimlet. Gin is a natural companion to lime, and the spirit\u2019s dry, botanical nature adds structure to the drink while keeping the sugar in check."

Featuring vodka, cranberry juice and grapefruit juice, it\u2019s often grouped with similar drinks of the era, like the Cape Codder (vodka and cranberry) and the Bay Breeze (vodka, cranberry and pineapple). That makes sense, as the cocktails do contain a common thread among their ingredients. But the Sea Breeze enjoys a history all its own.",
			"Despite its significant \u201980s street cred, the Sea Breeze likely originated decades earlier, although in a different form than it\u2019s known today. Harry Craddock\u2019s famed 1930 tome, \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book,\u201d includes a recipe for the Sea Breeze Cooler, which calls for equal parts dry gin and apricot brandy, plus half a lemon and two dashes of grenadine. It\u2019s served over ice, topped with club soda and garnished with mint. Though a much different cocktail than today\u2019s version, many believe this to be the basis for the modern Sea Breeze. And the recipe changeup may be due to some clever marketing by a cranberry consortium.",
			"By the 1960s, Ocean Spray\u2014originally founded as a growers\u2019 collective in 1930\u2014began publishing recipe booklets to promote using the tart little berries in more foods and drinks. Naturally, this push included cocktails. One particular cocktail was dubbed the Sea Breeze and featured cranberry juice, which may be the first instance of the popular drink containing cranberry.",

The cocktail is thirst-quenching, delicious and simple to make, so it\u2019s easy to see why it caught on. Bottled cranberry juice continues to be the popular choice, as fresh juice is typically too tart to work by itself. But freshly squeezed grapefruit is always a good idea. Its rich citrus notes contribute to the cocktail\u2019s restorative sensibilities and quaffability.",
			"The Sea Breeze is ready to help, whether you\u2019re on a beach or just trying to conjure beach vibes with your drinking habits. Built in the same glass you drink it in, there\u2019s no easier way to bring the sunny weather your way."

		"description": [
			"The Bloody Mary is perhaps the most iconic breakfast drink, an enlivening mixture of tomato juice, vodka and spices. Its strength stems from its versatility, and every bartender has their own take on the recipe, one they claim is the best interpretation. Often, this means incorporating hot sauces, spices, vinegars and other modifiers.",
			"The Bloody Elixir is one such variation. The recipe comes from H. Joseph Ehrmann. He is a lauded San Francisco bartender and owner of Elixir Saloon (from where the drink gets its name), one of the Bay Area\u2019s oldest taverns. His take on the drink doesn\u2019t get too wild: Most elements of it would be familiar to anyone who has messed around with Bloody Mary concoctions. However, he has a few of his own additions, including dried dill and a house-made \u201cElixir Juice,\u201d a mixture of pickle and olive brines. Though the recipe isn\u2019t explicitly outlined, you can make the Juice by mixing olive brine, dill pickle brine and then whatever other pickle brines you most enjoy. It\u2019s flexible, so don\u2019t stress about the proportions.",
			"Ehrmann is a big lover of Square One, an organic distillery located in the Bay Area. Many of his drinks, including the Bloody Elixir, use the distillery\u2019s vodka, but feel free to swap it for whatever vodka you have on hand. Ehrmann suggests a rye vodka, as that style better stands up to the other ingredients. Or you can try another spirit, if you prefer the extra aromatics of aquavit or the earthy spice of tequila.",
			"When it comes to any Bloody Mary variant, the garnish is critical. Some recipes call for an abundance of vegetables or even ingredients like bacon, fried chicken or shrimp skewers. Ehrmann\u2019s version is relatively modest, calling for only bacon and a pickle. You can always omit the pork (or swap it for a vegan product) if you\u2019d prefer. And, rather than salt or a flavored-salt rim, Ehrmann lines his glass with Old Bay seasoning. This classic East Coast seafood spice is a lovely enhancement for the drink, so Ehrmann encourages bartenders to serve the cocktail without a straw, so that each sip carries with it some of the Old Bay."

Likely, the most famous of the savory family of drink is the Bloody Mary and its many offshoots. However, others, less famous, also exist, and one such drink is the Bull Shot, which essentially swaps the tomato juice in the Bloody Mary for beef bouillon while keeping the Worcestershire, spices and hot sauce.",
			"Despite its name, however, the Bull Shot is generally served as a full drink\u2014that gets altered with the Pho-King Champ, which swaps the beef bouillon for Vietnamese soup broth and serves the whole thing as a single savory shot. \u201cA twist on the classic Bull Shot reimagined through the lens of Vietnamese pho,\u201d is how Chad Solomon, the co-creator of Midnight Rambler in Dallas, describes it. The name is a nod to the defunct San Francisco avant rock band The Fucking Champs, who were forced to change their name from The Champs when they were called out by the original 1950s band.",
			"Along with vodka and a bit of dry sherry for some extra salinity and richness, the house-made pho broth is the backbone of the drink. While labor-intensive, it provides an intense depth of flavor. If you don\u2019t want to take the time to make it, you can set aside a few ladlefuls from your favorite pho joint. However, if you do opt to make the broth for the drink, there\u2019s nothing keeping you from adding some noodles, bean sprouts and Thai basil to the leftovers for a full bowl of soup at home."

The original recipe, created by bartender Nick Mautone back in 2007, originally called for Grey Goose, but any of your favorite vodkas will do. The real star of this drink is perhaps the raspberry liqueur (Chambord, specifically), which many bartenders and drink enthusiasts tend to write off as somewhat old-school given its heavy use behind the bar in decades past. \u201cChambord is one of the first modifiers we\u2019ve all used as young bartenders,\u201d says\u00a0Jason Sorbet, beverage director at The Chloe in New Orleans. \u201c[This] French liqueur is unique in that it\u2019s more than just a fruit liquor.

			"At the now-closed New York cocktail oasis Pegu Club, proprietor Audrey Saunders\u2019\u00a0Gin-Gin Mule rightfully earned a place in the modern-day cocktail canon. Saunders has described this gingery cocktail as a cross between a Moscow Mule (another ginger beer-based drink) and a Mojito (usually a rum drink but here made with gin).",
			"While this refreshing cocktail certainly can be made with canned ginger fizz, it is even better when mixed with house-made ginger beer. And ginger beer is remarkably easy to make at home.",
			"\u201cStore-bought stuff has a peppery, more than gingery, profile,\u201d says Saunders, interviewed in the book \u201cNew York Cocktails\u201d (Cider Mill Press, $20) by Amanda Schuster. In addition, many brands can be \u201cinsipid,\u201d she says.",
			"And don't confuse ginger beer with ginger ale. The former has a far stronger ginger flavor and spicy kick than the latter, which is, essentially, ginger-flavored soda.",
			"While Pegu Club makes ginger beer by the gallon, here\u2019s a smaller-scale version to try at home. It takes a little time: Note the one-hour wait for the ingredients to fully integrate. But the reipce yields enough for several cocktails, since only an ounce of this gingery elixir is all that\u2019s needed for one Mule. The recipe does not call for carbonation, however. To make it bubbly, add sparkling water, seltzer or club soda, to taste."

Now, it\u2019s difficult to find a bar that doesn\u2019t offer the Moscow Mule, either on its menu or as an off-menu call. Of course, like any simple classic, it has spurred endless variations over the years. Barkeeps will switch the base spirit, making their own ginger beer and experimenting with fruits, herbs and other ingredients. Case in point: the London Mule.",

			"It\u2019s difficult to fudge this drink, but high-quality ingredients are key. Choose a London dry gin if you like the bracing bite of juniper, or try a more contemporary style if you prefer your gins to lead with citrus or other botanicals. Whichever route you go, make sure to unite that gin with good ginger beer and fresh lime juice to create the best-tasting drink. And serve in a copper mug, if you have one, to keep it cold from start to finish.",
			"If you like the London Mule, chances are strong that you will also like the Gin-Gin Mule, which was popularized at the famous New York bar Pegu Club. It\u2019s a slight variation that features fresh mint and a little simple syrup alongside the gin, ginger and lime."

Vodka would make for a brighter, less spirited flavor profile while something like brandy, rum or whiskey would give the punch a darker, more lush tone. However darker spirits can potentially raise the sweetness of the drink, especially rum, so be sure to taste for sugar content before making a big batch. If too sweet, pull back on the pomegranate juice.",

Her take on the Three Dots & a Dash\u2014a WWII-era Tiki classic created by the famed Donn Beach of Don the Beachcomber\u2014swaps out the traditional rum seen in most Tiki drinks for bourbon, specifically Coopers\u2019 Craft bourbon. Allspice dram, golden falernum, Angostura bitters, fresh lime and orange juices and a touch of honey round everything out for a playful and layered drink.",

Beyond Donn Beach\u2019s cocktail recipe, it also is the name of a famous speakeasy-style Tiki bar in Chicago, also named for the drink. However, its original recipe, like the vast majority of Tiki creations, called for rum. The use of bourbon, in this case Coopers\u2019 Craft, a Kentucky straight bourbon from Brown-Forman, means that the drink leans drier, with more oak and vanilla notes.",
			"While it\u2019s a relatively straightforward Tiki drink, it does call for two ingredients you may not have in your home bar: allspice dram and falernum. Griffin uses St. Elizabeth for the allspice, which is the most well-known of allspice dram brands. The dram is used in Tiki drinks to add warmth, spice and baking notes to the often bright and juicy drinks. Similarly, falernum, a ginger syrup, is a widely used Tiki ingredient. Its most well known producer is John D Taylor\u2019s Velvet Falernum, but Griffin uses The Bitter Truth Golden Falernum, a rich and slightly spicy mix of ginger, vanilla, lime and other spices. While not all brands of falernum contain alcohol, the Bitter Truth\u2019s version has 18% alcohol-by-volume, making it a more potent concoction for use in drinks like Three Dots & a Dash.",

You can play with the ratios to create a rich simple syrup, which is two parts sugar to one part water, or you can doctor your syrup with fruits, herbs and spices to achieve a new flavor profile.",
			"One of the more versatile examples is vanilla simple syrup, which can be used to add the sweet, heady flavor of vanilla to a variety of cocktails. And it\u2019s no more difficult to make than regular simple syrup, as the only extra step is to add vanilla extract to the water and sugar mixture.",
			"However, there\u2019s more than one way to achieve that vanilla flavor. Instead of using extract, you could infuse your simple syrup with a vanilla bean pod. In that case, cut the pot in half lengthwise, add it to the hot liquid, and let sit for several hours before using. The result is very similar to using extract, but one pod goes a long way, producing a clearer, more intense flavor.",
			"The best part about homemade vanilla simple syrup is that it can easily be adapted to any size you require. If you\u2019re making syrup for a party, or want to keep a large stash on hand, scale up the ingredients while keeping the proportions the same. Just multiply each component by the number of servings you want to make.",

			"Although few classic recipes call for vanilla simple syrup, it can be used to modify classics or add rich sweetness to original drinks.

			"Southerners love their sweet tea in summer. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere\u2013\u2013at every restaurant, every gas station,\u201d says bartender Weisi Basore of the classic iced drink brewed from black tea and often spiked with a mountain of sugar. \u201cWith the hot, muggy weather, it\u2019s just about the most refreshing thing you can drink.\u201d",
			"So in scheming the cocktail menu at casual small-plates eatery Bar Cleeta in Bentonville, Arkansas, that Basore opened with her chef-husband, Trae Basore, she felt compelled to pay tribute to the drink. Her Forefathers cocktail is a sweet-tea-laced rendition of an Old Fashioned that appropriately fits into Bar Cleeta\u2019s cocktail collection: simple, classic-inspired libations made from just a few seasonal ingredients.",
			"The cocktail is firmly in line with the restaurant\u2019s New American meets Southern-inflected menu, where you\u2019re likely to find charred chile-spiked market beans with caramelized sour cream and hazelnut gremolata or an onion and bacon tarte flamb\u00e9.",
			"\u201cWe thought we should bring a little bit of the metropolitan-style dining to the area,\u201d says Weisi Basore, adding that despite a bit of polish, her husband\u2019s food is still \u201cincredibly homey and rustic.\u201d",
			"Basore helped the late Sasha Petraske open now-defunct White Star bar on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side more than a decade ago and credits the cocktail pioneer with her training. From there, she eventually moved on to Manhattan\u2019s lauded seasonal New American restaurant Blue Hill. Meanwhile, also in New York, her husband moved over from executive sous chef at Colicchio & Sons to executive chef at popular wine bar Pearl & Ash (both now closed). The couple spent a year or so in Los Angeles before committing to Trae\u2019s hometown in Arkansas.",
			"The Forefathers is liquid tribute to the South\u2013\u2013one that incorporates the region\u2019s most beloved summer refreshment and its prime summer fruit, peaches. To build the drink, she first makes a sweet tea oleo saccharum by macerating citrus with sugar, then cooks the mixture with sweet tea to form a syrup. She stirs that over ice with bourbon and a few dashes of peach bitters. \u201cThe oleo saccharum brings a hint of citrus to the sweet tea syrup and rounds out this version of an Old Fashioned,\u201d she says."

That doesn\u2019t have to be so, as Jason Shullo, the beverage director for\u00a0Golden Entertainment, which operates casinos and resorts in Nevada and Maryland, explains. \u201cYou can overcome this stigma by using small amounts of it in craft cocktails to balance smoky flavors and enhance the peach taste,\u201d he says. \u201cPeach goes well with orange, ginger and vanilla to complement these flavors and bring out the fruitiness.\u201d",
			"According to Shullo, peach schnapps works well in bourbon-based drinks like Smashes, Cobblers or Julep. In his nuanced version of an Old Fashioned, the bourbon accentuates the liqueur\u2019s peach notes and bitters temper its sweetness. Shullo uses Woodford Reserve in his recipe, a high quality, well-regarded small-batch bourbon from Kentucky. With two and a half ounces in the drink, it creates a bold, assertive Old Fashioned, with the peach schnapps acting as an enhancement more than a center stage player. Given its sweetness, the schnapps also stands in for the usual simple syrup.",

But it\u2019s important to use a top-tier cherry like a Luxardo maraschino cherry rather than one of those electric red artificial cherries that top a Shirley Temple.

			"The White Negroni was invented in 2001 by British bartender Wayne Collins at VinExpo, a beverage trade show in Bordeaux, France. He wanted to create a Negroni riff that featured gin but not Campari or sweet vermouth. To replace those two stalwarts, he reached for a couple of French ingredients: Suze, a bittersweet gentian liqueur and Lillet Blanc, a wine-based aperitif. The former plays the role of bittering agent, similar to Campari, while the latter does the work of the vermouth.",

During this nascent era of mixed drinks the legendary Jerry Thomas\u2014considered by many to be the forefather of modern bartending\u2014was among the first to record recipes and separate them into various categories. One such category was known as the Improved Cocktail, and among those was the Improved Holland Gin Cocktail.",

Though Wondrich\u2019s consolidation of the varied \u201cimproved\u201d recipes includes maraschino as a core ingredient, other versions of the recipe call for orange cura\u00e7ao, instead.",
			"The Improved Holland Gin Cocktail uses genever, sometimes referred to as Holland or Dutch gin, as its base. The predecessor to modern gins, genever is made with a distilled malt wine and then distilled again with juniper berries. Generally, it\u2019s a richer, darker spirit than a London dry gin, and less prevalent in modern drinks.",
			"When making Jerry Thomas\u2019 version of the Improved Holland Gin Cocktail, the most notable brand of genever is Bols. The company has been making the spirit since the 17th century, and today it continues to be an exemplar of the style. The brand produces three distinct styles of genever, including an aged version and a 100%-malt version, but the best one to go with is the original. However, Bols has competition, with many Dutch brands as well as distillers in the United States and other countries crafting their own takes on the historic spirit.",
			"Another aspect to the drink is its proportions: Besides the genever, all the ingredients in the cocktail are listed as dashes. Traditionally, a dash is somewhere around 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon, so if you don\u2019t have bottle tops that allow for dashes of things like cura\u00e7ao or absinthe, you can use measuring spoons.

			"Rum is a versatile spirit. Though it\u2019s often employed in refreshing, citrusy drinks like the Daiquiri or rich, tropical drinks like the Painkiller, rum is a complex liquor loaded with flavor and nuance that is just as successful in stirred, spirit-forward cocktails. Aged rums, especially, can bring oak and spice notes to traditional whiskey drinks like the Old Fashioned\u2014or, in this case, the Toronto.",
			"The Toronto is part Old Fashioned and part Manhattan, combining Canadian rye with the bitter Italian amaro Fernet-Branca, simple syrup and aromatic bitters. It\u2019s deep, dark and bittersweet. At The Patterson House in Nashville, Strategic Hospitality beverage director Matthew Tocco wanted to make a version of the Toronto cocktail that swapped out whiskey for aged rum.",
			"Tocco\u2019s version, called Brother\u2019s Keeper, uses Ron Zacapa Centenario, a blend of rums aged between six and 23 years that has aromas and flavors of dried fruit, oak, leather, tobacco, coffee and vanilla. He keeps the fernet, tweaks the sugar by using a richer demerara sugar syrup, and adds chocolate bitters to the mix.",

The Rancor\u2019s Toothpick is an example of the the way Star Wars can even show up in drinks. Named for the monstrous, toothy creature that Jabba the Hutt would feed his victims to in \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d (no, not that toothy monster Jabba would feed his victims to, the other one), the drink was created by bartender Timothy Miner of New York City\u2019s beloved Long Island Bar.",

For whiskey, Miner uses Old Forester Signature 100-proof bourbon, which is an excellent choice for the price point. The stronger proof works well in a drink with amaro and sweet vermouth, making a bold, yet balanced, cocktail. And while his brother-in-law may be a bourbon fan, there\u2019s nothing wrong with substituting a rye whiskey.

			"In a historical sense, the Old Fashioned is the Platonic form of a cocktail. Its ingredients comprise spirit, bitters, sugar and water, a cocktail in the truest sense of the word. Originally made with any number of spirits, often brandy, over the decades the idea of an Old Fashioned became codified into including whiskey, generally bourbon. And while the Bourbon Old Fashioned does reign as king even today, there are alternatives. And one such exemplar is the Rum Old Fashioned.",
			"There\u2019s a lot to be said about making your Old Fashioned with an aged rum. Like bourbon it sees time in a barrel, which smooths out its harsher edges, adds notes of vanilla and caramel, and increases its depth and complexity, all of which leads to a beautiful marriage with bitters, some sweetener and orange zest. Also, possibly even more so than with whiskey, using an aged rum means versatility. Want something odd and funky? Try playing with Jamaican rums, many of which possess a funk that is referred to as hogo. Looking for something a little more similar to whiskey? Then opt for a gold rum from Barbados, where rums are often aged in whiskey barrels. Want an Old Fashioned that will knock your socks off? Try it with a navy-strength rum (though you\u2019ll really want to limit yourself to only one if you go this route).",

			"When using maple syrup rather than simple, a little goes a long way. The sweetness of maple syrup can vary, so it\u2019s best to to start with less and add more. You can always make a drink sweeter, but unless you want to keep adding more rum, it\u2019s hard to make it less sweet.",
			"While a simple recipe, the versatility of rum in this drink creates some fun opportunity to experiment.

			"Some drinks look strange on paper. If you\u2019ve ever mixed even a single Manhattan or an Old Fashioned, you\u2019re familiar with the dark, potent powers of Angostura bitters. Most cocktails that call for the ingredient take only a dash or two to add some complexity and bolster flavors, essentially like finishing a dish with salt and pepper. Using an entire ounce and a half of the highly aromatic bitters as the base of the cocktail is almost unheard of. But that\u2019s what\u2019s called for in the Trinidad Sour, an unusual-yet-delicious drink from Las Vegas bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez.",
			"Angostura bitters clock in around 45% alcohol, so using it as the base of the cocktail is similar to using a whiskey or rum in terms of alcohol level and potency. The big difference is the intense, bold botanicals of the bitters, the exact recipe of which is a closely guarded secret. There\u2019s not really a comparable spirit; while some of the more botanical-heavy, bittersweet amari would be closest, they usually lack the high proof and the intensity. You could try using Fernet-Branca, but in a way, doing so defeats the purpose of the Trinidad Sour.",
			"The bitters are bolstered with a half-ounce of rye whiskey to lend some additional spice and structure\u2014whichever rye you prefer for your Manhattan or Sazerac will fit here nicely. For sweetness, the drink gets an ounce of orgeat rather than the more familiar simple syrup. This nut-based syrup can sometimes be hard to find on store shelves, but brands like BG Reynolds, Liber & Co. and even Torani sell bottles of it online. If you want, you can always have a go at making your own orgeat.",
			"Along with the orgeat, lemon juice helps balance the herbal intensity of the bitters. All together it makes the Trinidad Sour a rich delight that carries through to the last sip."

			"Coffee cocktails aren\u2019t just for brunch anymore. Besides being a conduit for caffeine, coffee is full of oils and rich flavors that pair nicely with a variety of spirits and liqueurs, from whiskey and rum to bittersweet amari. So, to explore the depths of coffee as a cocktail ingredient, bartenders across the country are reaching for drip coffee, espresso, cold-brew and even coffee syrups to enliven their drinks.",
			"Head bartender Nicholas Boden is one such bartender. He invented this bittersweet, Italian take on the classic Espresso Martini for his bar at Tavernonna Italian Kitchen at the Hotel Phillips in Kansas City, Missouri. The most obvious change to the recipe is the omission of a base spirit\u2014normally, the Espresso Martini is made with vodka, but Boden\u2019s version is more like a slightly boozy espresso shot. In it, espresso is enhanced with an amaro and Kahl\u00faa, making for a rich, botanical and dark drink with as much caffeine as it has alcohol, if not more.",
			"For the amaro, Boden uses Amaro Averna, a century-plus-old liqueur from Sicily that is popular amongst cocktail bartenders for its use in drinks. Unlike some other amari, it\u2019s gentle and reserved, good for sipping after dinner but also for mixing with ingredients like sherry, whiskey and rum. Its subtle but present citrus notes pair nicely with bittersweet espresso, especially when sweetened.",
			"For the sweet element of the concoction, Boden uses Kahl\u00faa liqueur. A natural fit for any coffee drink, given that it\u2019s made with coffee itself, Kahl\u00faa shows up in a number of well-known drinks including the White Russian and, most notably, the original recipe for an Espresso Martini. However, with only half an ounce used in the recipe, the amount of added caffeine is negligible, especially considering how much is already in the espresso.",

			"The Negroni is an Italian classic and the wonder child of modern cocktail bartending, in large part because of the endless opportunity for variations and riffs upon it. In fact, some consider the Negroni to be, essentially, a family of cocktails: a base spirit, an amaro or other bitter liqueur and a vermouth, each in equal (or close to equal) parts.",
			"Some variations are established enough to have their own name, like the rye or bourbon-based Boulevardier or the Negroni Sbagliato, made with prosecco rather than gin. And although the liquor swap in a scotch Negroni is a simple one, it\u2019s very much its own drink and has a dedicated fan base amongst bartenders. \u201cTo a degree, all Negronis are chasing the same flavor profile: strong, balanced, bitter, with a sweetness from the vermouth. But each one is a specialty in its own right,\u201d says Shawn Soole, a bartender and consultant based in Victoria, B.C. His take on the scotch Negroni is the Drunk Uncle, and it relies on whisky from that famed island off the southwestern coast of Scotland, renowned for its peat-forward whiskies: Islay.",
			"Unlike the Boulevardier or the popular Mezcal Negroni, Soole\u2019s Drunk Uncle doesn\u2019t use the Negroni\u2019s signature bitter liqueur, Campari; Nor does it call for the usual sweet vermouth. Instead, Soole uses Cynar, a bittersweet, artichoke-based amaro, and bianco vermouth from Martini & Rossi. \u201cEvery cocktail depends on the brands you use. A light, balanced, smoky Islay whisky works well with Cynar amaro and bianco vermouth but doesn\u2019t play well with Aperol or Campari,\u201d says Soole. \u201cSomething will be off-balance.\u201d In balacing the drink, he also uses a two-to-one-to-one ratio, rather than the usual equal parts that a Negroni calls for.",

			"John Filkins, the beverage director at Officina and Masseria in Washington, D.C., wanted to create a richer version of a Boulevardier, including adding a whiff of smoke. The Revenant was the outcome; its name means \u201cthe returned,\u201d usually in the context of returning from the dead, and it includes an unconventional form of smoke. Rather than using an exceptionally peaty scotch or adding a mezcal float, he instead boils Fee Brothers Aztec chocolate bitters and cardamom bitters. Since the bitters are both glycerin-based they smoke rather than burning the way those made from alcohol would. Filkins uses a Turkish coffee pot\u2014also known as an ibrik or\u00a0cezve\u2014whose high heat tolerance means it nearly instantaneously smokes the bitters when they hit the hot surface.",
			"To capture the smoke, invert a snifter over the hot pot until it\u2019s filled, then quickly place a coaster over the mouth of the glass to seal it. At Officina and Masseria, bartenders or servers will bring the glass to the table and pour the drink from a carafe over the smoke, bringing spectacle to the service. \u201cThe smoke adds a wow factor when it goes to the table, and chocolate and cardamom bring aromatic complexity and warm baking spices,\u201d Filkins says.",
			"While the Revenant is based on the Boulevardier (a whiskey-based variation on the Negroni), it uses neither Campari nor vermouth. Instead, vermouth is replaced by Chinato, a fortified and aromatized wine that is flavored with quinine, the same ingredient that gives tonic water its telltale bitterness. That quinine is necessary for balance, as the Revenant substitutes dry cura\u00e7ao, an orange liqueur, for the usual Campari that would lend the drink bitterness. \u201cChinato is a great replacement for vermouth and adds an herbal complexity, [while] dry cura\u00e7ao helps to lift it,\u201d says Filkins."

A cocktail by the same name was created by Erskine Gwynne, the publisher of \u201cBoulevardier,\u201d a magazine for expats living in Paris during the 1920s. The drink was popularized after it was included in Harry MacElhone\u2019s 1927 book\u00a0\u201cBarflies and Cocktails.\u201d In it, the author credited the cocktail to Gwynne, a regular at MacElhone\u2019s bar.

The difference in flavor, however, is anything but simple. While the gin-based Negroni is crisp and bracing, the whiskey-based Boulevardier is rich and warming. It\u2019s the exact drink you want to reach for on a chilly fall or winter evening.",
			"When making the Boulevardier, choose your ingredients wisely. The best examples hinge on a happy marriage between the base spirit and the sweet vermouth. Now\u2019s not the time to be cheap with either, as both play integral roles in balancing the flavor and weight of the cocktail. Most recipes utilize bourbon, though some people prefer the spicier quality of rye whiskey. Both have their charms, but today you\u2019re most likely to find the Boulevardier made with bourbon.",
			"While the Negroni calls for its ingredients in equal parts, this recipe (like many others) features the whiskey in a slightly higher proportion, allowing it to cut through the bitter Campari and the rich, herbal vermouth. Stir them all together with ice, garnish with an orange twist, and take yourself back to 1920s Paris."

			"Sarah Turbett, a musician and bartending expert in Nashville, Tennessee, came up with the idea for this brain-freeze-inducing cocktail while thinking about her favorite flavors of summer and fall growing up in Tennessee. \u201cTennessee whiskey, summer peach and vinegar notes brighten up fall spices, orange peel and licorice, transporting your palate from the warm end of summer to the early crisp autumn breeze,\u201d she says. \u201cLight enough to enjoy during the heat but complex enough to hold up to a piece of pumpkin pie, this cocktail is the perfect drink for the end of summer. Imagine sipping on this frozen cocktail on your porch in a great wooden rocking chair, watching the sun go down in a golden sky over amber fields.\u201d",
			"Frozen cocktails are somewhat of an art form in that achieving the perfect texture (and ensuring that it won\u2019t turn to liquid right away) is a feat when working with alcohol over a certain proof, which won\u2019t actually freeze at the temperature of a standard freezer (usually around zero degrees Fahrenheit). That said, spirits certainly won\u2019t maintain an icy texture on their own for very long at room temperature or higher, so striking a balance in both chemical makeup and flavor with a cocktail\u2019s non-alcoholic or low-proof ingredients is key. Turbett\u2019s preparation method is extra icy, too, for good measure\u2014blending the drink with a cup of ice and serving it over a cup of fresh ice means that you can sip this Southern belle on a wraparound porch in late August without worry.",

		"description": [
			"While the Gin & Tonic is often considered more of a warm weather drink, this approach from Canyon Shayer of Philadelphia Distilling incorporates fall flavors with an apple chai syrup. With the inclusion of the caffeinated tea, it takes the G&T from its iconic late-night status to a brunch-friendly highball.",
			"With apple cider vinegar and a slightly spicy chai tea, the apple chai syrup proves not too sweet, with nuances light enough that you don\u2019t want a strong spirit to overpower them. Since Shayer works with Philadelphia Distilling he naturally goes for the company\u2019s gin, Bluecoat American dry gin, for the cocktail\u2019s base. With gentle botanicals it serves well in the drink, but it\u2019s not widely available outside of Pennsylvania. Those who want something similar can find it with other American dry gins like Aviation American gin or Copper & King\u2019s American dry gin. A London dry gin like Tanqueray or Plymouth will work fine as the drink\u2019s base, but the aromatics and botanicals won\u2019t be the same.",
			"When it comes to selecting a tonic, the drier the better. Normally, Gin & Tonics aren\u2019t made with simple syrup or other sweeteners, so the 3/4 ounce of apple chai syrup will noticeably raise the sweetness level. Q tonic is relatively austere, making it a good choice, and Fever Tree is always reliable. If your Apple Chai G&Ts are still coming out too sweet, you can always pull back on the syrup.",
			"A benefit of the Apple Chai G&T is that if you\u2019ve had your fill of the highball but still have leftover apple chai syrup, you can use it in other drinks. Perhaps the most obvious use for it would be switching the simple syrup in an Old Fashioned for the apple chai syrup; apple and chai spices pair well with dark spirits like brandy, bourbon and aged rum, and will give the drink an autumnal touch. Use it in drinks like the Ruby Chai Appletini for even deeper apple and chai flavors, or sweeten your favorite Hot Toddy recipe with it for extra fall flavors."

Throughout history, aromatic elderflower blossoms were widely praised for their medicinal properties, but fortunately, you don\u2019t need a prescription to enjoy this delicious cordial today.",

The elderflower lends a floral sweetness to the dry, bubbly wine, while the club soda balances that sweetness with a dose of dilution and more effervescence.",

			"When the weather gets cooler and the leaves turn vivid reds, oranges and yellows, many bartenders reach for darker spirits for their drinks, especially whiskey. But fall cocktails don\u2019t have to be dark, bittersweet affairs. Instead, spirits like gin can capture autumnal flavors, especially when paired with fall produce like apples or pears. Bartender Chris Chamberlain exemplifies this with his drinks the Autumn Apple and the Perfect Pear, both of which use Bluecoat American Dry Gin from Pennsylvania.",
			"The Perfect Pear sees a number of familiar combinations: gin and elderflower liqueur (most commonly St-Germain, though there are other brands) is a time-honored pairing, and champagne is often found paired with both. With lemon juice adding tartness and fresh pear puree lending the autumnal notes and amplifying the fruitiness, it makes for a bright, bubbly drink that still captures the feeling of the turning of the seasons.",
			"As with any drink, there are some substitutions you can make if you cannot find some of the ingredients. Bluecoat, for instance, isn\u2019t available in all markets, and another gin can stand in for it if needed. Still, it\u2019s not the same as a traditional London dry gin like Tanqueray or Beefeater. Other American dry gins, like Aviation American Gin from Portland, Oregon, California\u2019s St. George Terroir Gin and Louisville\u2019s Copper & Kings American Dry Gin are all closer approximations, with herbs like coriander and more citrus notes.",
			"Similarly, while champagne is often called for in sparkling wine drinks like this, the single splash called for in the Perfect Pear makes it hard to justify popping the cork on a bottle of the world\u2019s most famed sparkling wine. Instead, feel free to use an American sparkling wine (there are plenty of top-notch examples) or wines from other regions of the world that use the traditional method that Champagne is made with. You can even go with something like a prosecco or cava, though the brightness of those will affect the final product, so taste for balance before serving."

However, that\u2019s not always the case, as the Autumn Apple exemplifies. This gin drink comes from bartender Chris Chamberlain and in it autumn\u2019s favorite flavor takes center stage with a festive mix of apple cider, gin, honey syrup and cinnamon.",
			"For the base spirit, Chamberlain uses Bluecoat American dry gin. Rather than the traditional London dry gin with its juniper-heavy flavor profile, the Pennsylvania-made Bluecoat American gin has more citrus and floral notes, and holds back on the juniper. However, the copper-distilled Bluecoat American can be difficult to acquire outside of Pennsylvania. If you\u2019re unable to easily get your hands on it, you can switch it out for a more traditional London dry, or try the Autumn Apple with other styles of gin like Aviation, another American dry gin that leans less on juniper. These brighter, more citrus-forward gins like the Bluecoat will pair better with the apple cider, which notably should be a fresh-squeezed, and not a sparkling, alcoholic cider. This will better evoke the lush flavors of autumn, regardless of the time of year it\u2019s being imbibed.",
			"Essentially an apple cider take on a gin sour, the drink also calls for lemon juice, while honey syrup takes the place of simple syrup. This, too, gives the drink a darker, more autumnal tone without making it overly sweet or cloying. Cinnamon\u2014a fairly uncommon cocktail ingredient outside of the cinnamon syrups often used in Tiki drinks\u2014adds even more warmth and depth. However, it is important to use restraint when adding a pinch, as too much can overpower the drink and make it cloudy.

Wiznitzer is not the only person to put a creative spin on Campari and orange\u2014New York City bar Dante, for instance, is famous for its Garibaldi, for which bartenders \u201cfluff\u201d the orange juice with a handheld mixer until it\u2019s foamy and frothy. However, Wiznitzer goes a step further with her take on the drink, using a blood orange concentrate from The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley, as well as honey syrup and club soda.",
			"The blood orange concentrate brings an intense, orange-packed flavor to the drink, reduces the overall volume and, along with the honey syrup, mellows the bitterness of the Campari. However, the Make It Count would be overly rich and intense without dilution, so Wiznitzer includes an ounce of club soda, adding effervescence and brightening the drink without watering it down. The end result is a refreshing highball that you can enjoy on a hot afternoon or as an after-dinner treat.",
			"While the Make It Count is easy to throw together, with only a few ingredients stirred over ice, there is the aspect of the blood orange concentrate to contend with. Wiznitzer\u2019s choice is specific, a brand from the Napa Valley that produces a variety of fruit juice concentrates. Unfortunately, this means there are few, if any, clear substitutions. If the Perfect Puree brand is unavailable, try searching online markets for similar products. And if you\u2019re committed to making the drink and still can\u2019t find any blood orange concentrate online, you could try making your own through boiling or freezing juice.

While unorthodox, it comes together as a layered, intricate and refreshing drink.",
			"Parks uses Cimarron blanco tequila as the base of the cocktail, but, as with most tequila drinks like the Margarita or Paloma, you can substitute your favorite brand without altering the flavors too much. Just be sure to use a blanco tequila rather than a darker, aged one. Similarly, you can swap the El Silencio mezcal for another espadin mezcal of your choice (luckily, the vast majority of mezcals are made with espadin agave). The slight amount of mezcal in the cocktail adds subtle smoke and earthiness without overwhelming the tequila-forward flavor.",
			"The fennel juice is the true star of the show, though. If you have a juicer at home it will be a breeze to make\u2014simply throw a few fennel bulbs into the juicer and be greeted with some aromatic, anise-tinged root juice. If you don\u2019t have access to a juicer, then a blender is the way to go\u2014add a few bulbs to a blender and top with water, then pulse until it reaches a fine consistency. Strain the juice through a cheesecloth to separate out the pulp and solids.",
			"Though it takes a bit of work to build, the Calafia is a bright and vivid highball with unique botanical notes thanks to the fennel. Plus, you can always use the fennel juice in other drinks, playing around with what works and what doesn\u2019t."

It was first mixed in 1888\u00a0by Henry Charles\u00a0\u201cCarl\u201d Ramos\u00a0at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon in New Orleans. Along with drinks like the Sazerac, the Ramos Gin Fizz is one of the city\u2019s most identifiable cocktails, and one that has stood the test of time, as it\u2019s still in circulation today. However, this frothy classic is both loved and loathed by bartenders.",

The gin\u2014most recipes call for London dry, but Ramos himself used Old Tom, as was fashionable in his time\u2014provides a sturdy base for the cocktail, while the sugar and citrus add their trademark sweet-tart balance. Heavy cream lends richness, the egg white bulks up the mouthfeel, and the orange flower water provides a floral note. Finally, sparkling water lightens the drink, adding a touch of effervescence.",
			"Then, of course, there\u2019s the shaking. The story goes that Ramos employed a chain of \u201cshaker men\u201d in his bar to meet the constant demand from locals and tourists, who had become enamored with the labor-intensive cocktail. Supposedly, each drink was shaken for between 12 and 15 minutes, which we can all agree is a lot of minutes. But don\u2019t let that fun fact discourage you. Foamy, fresh, floral and delicious, the Ramos Gin Fizz is worth rolling up your sleeves for\u2014and today, most bartenders shake their Fizzes in under a minute.",
			"Acclaimed New Orleans barkeep Chris Hannah says that between 25 and 45 seconds is sufficient. If you want to use the dry-shake method, he suggests agitating the shaker for 10 seconds sans ice, and then giving it another vigorous go for 15 seconds with ice to ensure proper chilling and dilution. The result is a perfectly mixed Ramos Gin Fizz with a head that\u2019s the right amount of frothy\u2014thick, but not approaching meringue pie."

When winemakers have excess grapes on the vine that aren\u2019t going to ripen in time for harvest, or when they want to reduce yields so the resulting grapes produce more concentrated juice, they pick the unripe fruit and immediately press it. The result is a tart elixir that isn\u2019t drinkable on its own but one that can add acidity in a different way than citrus. \u201cVerjus has an acidity that\u2019s driven more on tartaric acid than on citrus acid,\u201d Stana says. \u201cBoth make your mouth pucker and deliver that acidity that your taste buds crave, but it\u2019s a different type of punch.\u201d Think of it, she says, as the difference between biting into a tamarind and a lemon wedge.",

Both sweet and sour with a subtle kick and the complexion of liquid kryptonite, the Apple Martini was a smash hit from the moment it burst onto the scene more than two decades ago.",
			"It all started one Fourth of July at a West Hollywood restaurant called Lola\u2019s, when owner Loren \u201cLola\u201d Dunsworth was approached by a representative from then-fledgling vodka brand Ketel One with the idea of making a signature Martini.",
			"Dunsworth noticed a lonely bottle of apple schnapps on the back bar and asked bartender Adam Karston to see if he could whip something up using the two. He combined equal parts DeKuyper Pucker sour apple schnapps imitation liqueur and Ketel One vodka and added a splash of house-made sweet-and-sour mix, and, just like that, a legend was born.",
			"The cocktail was so successful that it had to be taken off the menu. \u201cThey were easy to drink because you didn\u2019t really taste the alcohol,\u201d says Dunsworth. \u201cPeople were abusing them. I thought, Let\u2019s take it off for a while. But there was such an uproar that we quickly ended up putting it back.\u201d",
			"Within six months, word of the cocktail spread across the country, and soon every bar and restaurant worth its Martini menu was flaunting its own version of the green concoction. But none of them stood up to the original Appletini.",
			"One difference, says Dunsworth, is that Lola\u2019s garnished its drink with Granny Smith apple slices, which the bar marinated in lemon water and ice to keep fresh. \u201cPeople would say to me, \u2018Oh, my God, it just tastes so much better here.\u2019\u201d",
			"The Appletini marched proudly into the late-1990s and early aughts as a symbol of innocence and pre-9/11 America. Part punchline and part guilty pleasure, it was always the happy person\u2019s drink more than the cool kid\u2019s go-to. It\u2019s what Zach Braff\u2019s character ordered on \u201cScrubs\u201d and the toast of choice during the Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker meeting in \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d The Appletini was, by all definitions, a globally recognized modern classic.",

			"Day-drinking is a time-honored tradition, whether it\u2019s a weekend brunch, casual business lunch or during a vacation. However, with midday imbibing there\u2019s always a risk of over-indulgence leading to a sleepy, fuzzy afternoon. For those who want to skip the perils of the Martini lunch while still enjoying an adult beverage during the day, food and travel writer Kat Odell has the answers in her book \u201cDay Drinking: 50 Cocktails for a Mellow Buzz.\u201d One recipe in the book is the Django Reinhardt, which comes from Erick Castro of San Diego\u2019s Polite Provisions. It\u2019s a rare drink that uses vermouth as its main component, notes Odell, as opposed to using it in a support role like in a Manhattan.",
			"In essence, the Django Reinhardt is a sour that substitutes the usual hard liquor for vermouth. However, because vermouth has less body and viscosity than something like whiskey, gin or rum, the proportions are adjusted with 3 ounces of vermouth rather than the more typical 2 ounces of spirit that go into a drink like a Daiquiri or Gimlet.",
			"Besides the lower proof that allows for midday indulgence, the other benefit is the drink\u2019s versatility. The recipe calls for dry vermouth, and while a few years ago that meant a limited supply of options, today there are many. You can opt for something reliable like Dolin de Chambery or Noilly Prat, or you can go bold and experiment with one of the many new dry vermouths on the market. Some are older recipes that are only now being exported from their tiny European towns, while others are newer styles and approaches from small wineries across the world.",
			"Beyond traditional dry vermouth styles, there are a whole world of vermouths, like citrus-tinged blanco vermouth, bittersweet chinato or the newly revived style of sherry vermouth. Since the fortified wine is at the forefront of the Django Reinhardt it\u2019s a chance to explore the wide variety of options available. However, any substitution will affect the overall balance; it\u2019s always best to taste the product before serving in case you need to dial back the simple syrup or add more lemon juice (or switch out the vermouth you\u2019re using if it isn\u2019t working).",
			"Along with the vermouth, lemon juice and simple syrup, the drink calls for muddled orange, which adds brightness and sweetness while keeping the drink fresh and lively. The Django Reinhardt can be a fun replacement for your usual brunch Mimosa or happy hour drink."

			"Though not as renowned as drinks like the Manhattan, Sidecar or Martini, the Bobby Burns is a classic cocktail dating back to the early part of the 20th century. Similar to the Rusty Nail or Blood & Sand, it has the rare quality of being made with blended Scotch whisky rather than bourbon, rye or another spirit all together.",
			"Like many storied cocktails, the origins of the Bobby Burns are fuzzy. The first available source for it dates to 1902\u2019s bar book \u201cBishop & Babcock Company\u2019s Fancy Drinks,\u201d though in the book the recipe is referred to as the Baby Burns, and calls for one teaspoon each of vermouth and Benedictine, as well as a pony (generally considered one ounce) of scotch. Later, in texts like \u201cRecipes for Mixed Drinks\u201d in 1917 and 1930\u2019s seminal \u201cSavoy Cocktail Book\u201d from Harry Craddock, the name was changed to the Bobby Burns; while there is always going to be some debate as to the meaning of the name, it\u2019s likely an homage to the famed Robert Burns, widely considered the national poet of Scotland.",
			"The cocktail itself is similar to a Rob Roy (named for another famous Scot), the scotch-based Manhattan variation. However, this drink (usually) sees equal parts scotch and sweet vermouth, rather than two-to-one proportions, and substitutes the traditional dashes of bitters for a half ounce of Benedictine. This herbal liqueur, like Green Chartreuse, is made with a proprietary recipe known only by a handful of people. What is known is that there are 27 herbs and spices in its blend, and the Benedictine is an essential part of the Bobby Burns.",
			"While single malt scotches tend to get the most attention, blended scotches are more commonly used in mixed drinks. And though earlier recipes didn\u2019t specify, modern takes on the Bobby Burns tend to follow this style. There are plenty of quality blended Scotch whiskies on the market, from the more famous labels like Johnny Walker, Chivas Regal and Famous Grouse to lesser known and newer expressions. Whichever bottle you use, go with a 12-year-old, which lends more smoothness, richness and complexity.",
			"Similarly, the choice of sweet vermouth is up to you, but it\u2019s recommended to go with something on the dryer, more botanical side like Noilly Prat or Punt E Mes. A bit of lemon zest, its oils expressed over the surface of the drink, finishes the Bobby Burns, and the drink is best served with a few Scottish shortbread biscuits and a collection of the poet\u2019s works."

			"When it comes to drinks related to horse races, there is one clear standout: The Mint Julep, the famed signature drink of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. And while the Kentucky Derby is arguably the most famous of horse races in the United States, there are others. One such race is Preakness Stakes, held annually on the\u00a0third Saturday in May at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland.",
			"It\u2019s that race that gives the name to Preakness, a variation on the classic Manhattan. The drink comes from Allen Katz, a bartender, spirits expert and founder of the New York Distilling Company. He was also the host of \u201cThe Cocktail Hour\u201d for Martha Stewart Living Radio on SiriusXM. In his drink, Katz makes only one minor tweak to the original Manhattan recipe, but it adds a considerable amount of nuance\u2014he adds a splash of B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine.",
			"The French liqueur B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine is in that family of spirits where its ancient recipe\u2014reportedly developed in 1510 by the Benedictine monk Don Bernardo Vincelli\u2014is only known by a handful. Like Chartreuse, it\u2019s a tightly kept secret recipe consisting of dozens of botanicals, including angelica, hyssop and lemon balm. In bartending, the spirit is primarily known for its role in the famed Vieux Carr\u00e9 from New Orleans. However, it also serves well in this Manhattan, adding additional complexity and botanical depth.",
			"Katz is less specific about the other two major ingredients in the Preakness, though he does call for an American rye whiskey rather than a bourbon. Rye\u2019s signature spice works well in Manhattans generally, helping to cut through some of the sweetness of the vermouth. As with any drink, though, it is up to taste preferences, and no one will fault you for substituting your favorite bourbon. Similarly, the sweet vermouth is up to personal choice, but a higher quality vermouth will generally make a higher quality cocktail, admittedly with higher price tag, as well.",
			"One final, minor twist to the drink is in the choice of garnish: normally a Manhattan calls for the signature cherry, though some drinkers might prefer a thin slice of orange peel for the extra oils and aromatics. The Preakness calls for neither, but rather a lemon peel, whose oils will help brighten its dark, lush profile."

			"The Mint Julep and the Margarita are two springtime drinks that are inextricably linked with US holidays in the early part of May\u2014the Kentucky Derby is held on the first Saturday of May, while Cinco de Mayo is, naturally, the fifth of May. At times this means that the two holidays fall on the same day, or at least the same weekend, which leads to the occasional two-in-one holiday. Often it gets nicknamed Derby de Mayo or Cinco de Derby.",

Frosty silver cups filled with crushed ice, bourbon and mint? Or a glass filled with tequila, triple sec and lime? With the Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita, from tequila expert Gaston Martinez, you can enjoy both drinks at once\u2014with delicious results.",
			"There are a couple of key elements to this drink, and the primary one is the use of crushed ice. This allows for slow melting and dilution over time, mellowing the cocktail as it goes. Another is the choice of tequila.

			"The Mint Julep is a bourbon cocktail best known for being the signature drink of the Kentucky Derby. But this refresher composed of bourbon, sugar, mint and crushed ice shouldn\u2019t be reserved for only one day a year.",
			"The Mint Julep gained prominence in the southern United States during the 18th century, and it first appeared in print in 1803 in John Davis\u2019 book\u00a0\u201cTravels of Four and a Half Years in the United States of America.\u201d He wrote that the Mint Julep is a \u201cdram\u00a0of spirituous liquor that has mint steeped in it, taken by\u00a0Virginians\u00a0of a morning.\u201d An ice-cold whiskey drink is certainly one way to start your day.",
			"Since its creation, the Mint Julep has remained popular, but the julep itself is actually a category of drinks featuring a spirit served over crushed ice. So, it comes in more varieties than only bourbon and mint, and it\u2019s likely that the first juleps were made with cognac or even peach brandy. After the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-1800s, which infected France\u2019s grapevines and temporarily hindered that counry\u2019s cognac trade, whiskey became the julep\u2019s go-to liquor.",
			"The Mint Julep is traditionally served in a rocks glass or, ideally, in a silver julep cup. Since bourbon is the only liquid in the drink, you\u2019ll want to use a high-quality bottle that you know you love. A slightly higher-proof bourbon\u2014something in the mid-80s or around 90\u2014will keep the crushed ice from diluting the cocktail too quickly.",
			"This recipe comes from San Diego bartender Erick Castro. Try making it for yourself, and see how a few ingredients can combine for ultimate refreshment. Sure, the Mint Julep is typically consumed on Derby Day, but don\u2019t let that keep you from enjoying one whenever the mood strikes."

			"It\u2019s hard to find a drink more closely associated with afternoon quaffing in the sunshine than a Mint Julep. An herbaceous mix of spirits, sugar, and mint, the iconic beverage is a consummate drink for early hours, whether it\u2019s while taking in a horse race or just gathering with some friends on a lawn or patio. However, the bourbon in it can pack a mean punch, and keep you from enjoying more than one or two without the risk of getting seriously buzzed. Luckily, bartender veteran Alex Day, of the lauded cocktail bar Death & Co in New York City (amongst other bars), has an answer to the problem of Julep-driven over-intoxication: He makes a variation with a white wine, albari\u00f1o.",
			"This Spanish and Portugese varietal is bright and crisp, with plenty of fruit notes balanced by generous tart acid. Day originally used Terras Gauda Abadia de San Campio in his take on the Julep, and the wine\u2019s assertive acidity is smoothed by a bar spoon of Cr\u00e8me de P\u00eache, which stands in for the simple syrup that normally sweetens the drink. If Cr\u00e8me de P\u00eache isn\u2019t immediately available, Day advises that any good quality peach liqueur can work. Either way, it gives the drink a subtle but desirable hint of stone fruit. Similarly, any nice bottle of albari\u00f1o will do the trick in the drink, and the wine is generally on the affordable side of things, making it suitable for mixing in drinks.",
			"One of the benefits of this take on the summertime classic is the lower proof. Unlike with a drink made from bourbon\u2014especially higher proof bourbon like ones bottled in bond or barrel proof\u2014having a few of these while relaxing on a porch or garden won\u2019t knock you out. It\u2019s even less alcohol than even a standard glass of wine, with only three ounces of albari\u00f1o and a spoonful of peach liqueur.",
			"While some Mint Julep recipes call for muddling the mint in the glass, this one only requires a large bunch of fresh mint to garnish the drink and lend it the aromatics. Because of this, it\u2019s best to use a short straw and really get your nose into the leaves as you drink it (or just sip straight from the glass). A metal Julep cup generally has a wider mouth than most cocktail glasses, making it easier to get a mountain of crushed ice and a big bunch of mint in the drink. However, a double rocks glass works just fine if that\u2019s what\u2019s on hand."

Sometimes it was straight-forward: Just frozen and blended ros\u00e9, maybe with a bit of sweetener. Other recipes involved vodka or other hard alcohol giving an extra kick.

			"During the early days of the so-called Cocktail Renaissance\u2014when old recipes and lost spirits were being revived and bartenders were playing with all manner of ingredients\u2014vodka had a bit of a slump. Not so much in sales, as it remained the top-selling spirit on the market and likely will remain so, but at least in the eyes of bartenders and many fans of cocktail culture. Its role as a neutral-grain spirit\u2014that is a spirit without much in the way of assertive flavor\u2014saw it labeled as something approaching useless in \u201cserious\u201d drinks.",
			"However, one area where vodka shined, and where it continues to shine, was in infusions. Even today, when vodkas are starting to be more celebrated for their nuance, the relatively neutral characteristic of vodka lends it to infusion, letting the flavors of the added ingredients, whether they be fruit or herbs or something else, come through clearly. In the Ruby Patch, from bartender and bar owner H. Joseph Ehrmann, Numi organic chai tea is infused in vodka, which is then flavored with strawberries and mint.",
			"In this bright and fruity summer libation, Ehrmann opts for Square One Organic Vodka. As a San Francisco bar-owner, Square One is a local spirit to him, made right there in the Bay Area. Given that it\u2019s primarily a vessel for the tea, other vodkas can fill in, so feel free to use what you have on hand so long as it\u2019s of decent quality and doesn\u2019t come already flavored.",
			"The tea, on the other hand, is a little harder to substitute for. Ehrmann uses Numi Ruby Chai, a caffeine-free rooibos-based chai. The brightness of the South African red bush helps balance the rich spice from the chai blend, making for an overall brighter infusion. Like the Square One, Numi is local, as the company is based in Oakland. Still, other rooibos-based chais can stand in, if needed.",
			"To really punch up the brightness and fruitiness of this summery drink, it gets a handful of mint and strawberries muddled in it. As with all drinks that involve fresh fruit, it\u2019s best to wait until the berries are in season before making this drink.

		"description": [
			"Outside of drinks like the Mint Julep, bourbon is often considered to be more of an autumnal and wintery spirit, meant for sipping in front of fire places or in warm bars. Unlike tequila or rum, it\u2019s not generally considered a summer sipper. However, when combined with the right ingredients, bourbon can easily become an all-season, year-long spirit. One such ingredient that can be used to bring it into the warmer months is strawberries, that quintessential summer treat.",
			"Originally created by former bar lead Willem Van Leuven at San Diego\u2019s Herb & Wood and adapted by bar lead Emily Carroll, this take on the Old Fashioned rotates in a different flavored syrup depending on the seasonal produce that\u2019s available. \u201cThe strawberry-vanilla syrup that we use to add dimension to this cocktail was the result of a collaborative effort with our executive pastry chef Adrian Mendoza, who\u2019s the brains behind the berry syrup series and to date has developed a cranberry-cinnamon and blackberry-cinnamon, in addition to the strawberry,\u201d says Carroll.",
			"One of the best parts about the Bourbon & Berries recipe is its flexibility. For one, you can use the strawberry-vanilla syrup in other recipes. For instance, try substituting it for the simple syrup normally in a Daiquiri or for the sweetener in a Margarita to add a fruity touch to the classic drinks. Additionally, you can switch up the recipe for different fruits, like other berries in summer, or fall fruits like apple or pear, both of which marry with vanilla lovingly.",
			"Similarly, even the base spirit can be altered. While the purpose is to drink bourbon year-round, there\u2019s nothing stopping you from using another spirit in its stead. Rum, for instance, would make a lovely Old Fashioned with the strawberry-vanilla syrup. Or, you can hew closer to home and use a rye whiskey instead of a bourbon, for a little extra spice that pairs well with the vanilla aspect. The point is to have fun with a fruit syrup and an Old Fashioned base."

			"Normally, most cocktails have a single base spirit that they\u2019re built around, like the Bourbon Old Fashioned, Gimlet and Margarita. However, using more than one spirit can introduce complexities that a single spirit never could; the trick is finding a complementary pairing with a strong balance. In the Zapatero, a tweak on the Old Fashioned from California bartender Jeremy Lake, smokey mezcal is married with bourbon and sweetened by orgeat.",
			"This earthy, smokey take on the Old Fashioned uses El Silencio, a mezcal made by a ninth generation mezcalero. A reasonably priced mezcal, El Silencio has a nice balance of minerality, smoke and earthiness, making it a reliable choice for use in cocktails. Other popular choices for similarly priced mezcals of reputable quality include Banhez, Del Maguey Vida and Union Uno Mezcal.",
			"While mezcal is the main spirit in the drink, it gets some bourbon for additional depth and those familiar Old Fashioned notes of caramel, vanilla, oak and spices. Lake uses Booker\u2019s Bourbon in his recipe; however, prices on that have risen in recent years, and the cost for a standard 750-milliliter bottle of Booker\u2019s is around $100. There\u2019s only a half-ounce of the bourbon in the Zapatero, so buying a bottle wouldn\u2019t raise the overall cost of the drink by much, but a small volume like that also means that substituting another bourbon won\u2019t affect the quality of the finished product by much. Something like Knob Creek Bourbon, also crafted by Beam Suntory but retailing at half the price, would fill in nicely.",
			"Rather than using simple syrup, Lake opts for orgeat in his Mexican take on the Old Fashioned. This rich and cloudy syrup is traditionally made with almonds and orange flower water. There are a number of bottled versions on the market\u2014BG Reynolds, Fee Brothers and Orgeat Works each make a stand-up version of the famed Tiki syrup. However if you plan on making a big batch of Zapateros\u2014or other orgeat drinks like the Mai Tai\u2014it can be a worthwhile endeavor to try your hand at making your own. Beyond almonds, orgeat can also be made with nuts like hazelnuts or pistachios.",

Leave it to bars in Scotland, then, to come up with some\u2014the Campbeltown comes from Bramble Bar & Lounge in Edinburgh, a moody, stylish spot that often makes its way on to lists of the world\u2019s best cocktail bars. With a single malt whisky as its base, this stirred drink has bold, deep flavors for those who like their drinks strong yet nuanced.",
			"The Campbeltown is not a cheap drink to make by any means. It begins with Springbank 10-year-old-scotch, a well-balanced whisky with a $100 price tag. Besides giving the drink its bold smokiness and depth, it also gives it its name, as the Springbank distillery is located in Campbeltown. The single malt scotch has the depth and richness to stand up to the drink\u2019s green Chartreuse, a famous herbal liqueur made by Carthusian monks with a secret recipe. While not as expensive as the Springbank 10-year-old, it\u2019s still a pricey spirit, averaging $50 a bottle. Luckily, the drink only calls for half-an-ounce of it, and it can also be used in cocktails like the Last Word, Bijou and a number of others.",
			"The third element of this botanical, spirit-forward cocktail is Cherry Heering, a sweet and tart cherry liqueur. One of its most well-known uses is in another scotch cocktail\u2014the Blood & Sand. Other cherry liqueurs on the market, most famously maraschino liqueur, tend to be less sweet than Heering, so if you plan on substituting one of them be sure to taste for sweetness. You can always add a touch of simple syrup if need be.",
			"If the price tag per drink is intimidating, you could substitute a more affordable scotch. Blended whiskies often work well in mixed drinks and generally have a lower price tag, while another bold single malt would stand up well to the green Chartreuse. However, the flavor profile is balanced around the Springbank, so any change could lead to an inferior drink. Plus, the name wouldn\u2019t fit anymore, though that\u2019s less of a concern."

			"While bourbon and rye rules the whiskey cocktail world, with drinks from the Sazerac to the Manhattan, their brethren across the ocean in that gray and misty northern tip of the United Kingdom see less use in mixed drinks. Generally, scotch is consumed on its own, or maybe with a bit of water to help open up its flavors. But The Peat Monster from Compass Box Whisky needs no such aid in unlocking its bold and smoky self. It forms the base of the Rusty Compass from bartending veteran Meaghan Dorman, and while the drink won\u2019t do much to help you get home if you\u2019re lost at sea, it does, at least, taste delicious.",
			"In such a bold and potent concoction, the Peat Monster is assertive enough to not get lost in the rich flavors of Drambuie. It is a bit like doubling down, though, as Drambuie is a scotch-based liqueur flavored with honey, herbs and spices. There\u2019s a clear precedent, though: the Rusty Nail, a 2-to-1 mix of Scotch and Drambuie that gives the Rusty Compass the inspiration for the other part of its name.",
			"The Rusty Compass also gets some added bittersweetness from Cherry Heering Liqueur. This liqueur comes by way of Denmark and is a neutral grain spirit flavored with cherries and spices. Like Scotch and Drambuie, Scotch and Heering have a cocktail precedent, as well: the Blood & Sand, arguably the most famous of scotch drinks, also features a mix of Heering and scotch. If Heering isn\u2019t readily available, it\u2019s acceptable to substitute for another fine cherry liqueur like Luxardo maraschino. If using something like a kirsch, which is unsweetened, it might require a dash or two of simple syrup. However, using one of those substitutions will impact the drink\u2019s signature ruby hue.",

The sweet, creamy drink is best served as a nightcap or dessert cocktail, and it makes for a fun birthday shot with colorful sprinkles dappling the surface.",
			"While the bar at Three Muses calls for some specific ingredients in the Italian Cookie, there is room for substitutions, starting with the base itself. The recipe calls for Black Magic Black Spiced Rum, but that may not be readily available in all markets. Kraken is a popular and affordable brand of spiced rum, as are Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and Bacardi Spiced Rum. These days, though, there are plenty of options.",
			"The Italian Cookie also calls for Herbsaint, a deeply botanical pastis flavored with anise and other herbs. Herbsaint originally grew in popularity as an alternative to absinthe, which was banned in the United States until 2007 for its alleged (and nonexistent) hallucinogenic properties. Herbsaint still sees use in drinks like the Sazerac, but can be switched out for absinthe if desired. Similarly, while cr\u00e8me de noyaux is listed as an ingredient, amaretto is a suitable substitute; both liqueurs are almond flavored, though cr\u00e8me de noyaux has a bright red color to it. Those who do opt to use cr\u00e8me de noyaux can also use the red liqueur in a Pink Squirrel, another frothy-sweet concoction.",
			"Another key ingredient in the drink is fig preserves. Three Muses uses Rouses\u2019 fig preserves at its bar, a brand from a chain of supermarkets in Louisiana. As that might be difficult for people living outside of the South to get their hands on, any line of fig preserves, or homemade ones, will do the trick.",
			"Finally, the drink is blended and then garnished with sprinkles. This enhances the similarity to the Italian cookies found in tins, also known as Italian wedding cookies.

And while it\u2019s most often beer that is associated with football-related revelry, a cocktail can fit just fine, especially when that cocktail is made by a bartender specifically as an homage to an NFL team. That\u2019s the origin of the Autumn Wind, a Caribbean style drink made with rum, tequila, falernum and lime juice, which was made in honor of the Raiders.",
			"\u201cWith two and a half ounces of liquor, this is the perfect cocktail for an Oakland Raiders fan,\u201d says bartender Martin Delgado. Delgado made the drink while working at Prizefighter in Emeryville, California, well before the Raiders made their move to Las Vegas. \u201cBold and strong while pleasantly refreshing, that is always my take away from a Raiders tailgate and a Raiders win,\u201d he says.",
			"The Autumn Wind is a bit like a variation on a Daiquiri or a Mai Tai, with some tequila thrown in for good measure. The Raiders\u2019 pirate theme inspired the base of the Autumn Wind, Delgado explains. \u201cAnd as we are the Raiders, rum was without question the base spirit. Go, Raiders!\u201d However, the rum is used in an unconventional way. While it makes up half the volume of the drink and provides most of the alcohol, it does not get incorporated with the other ingredients. Rather, the tequila, falernum and lime are shaken together and served over crushed ice, while the black strap rum is floated on top. The result is a visually compelling double-layered drink. Of course, imbibing said cocktail will naturally blend the two sides together, or just give it a stir to incorporate the elements.",
			"Delgado uses Cruzan black strap rum, but any other black rum can do the trick. It\u2019s important use a black rum though, not something like an a\u00f1ejo. Dark and rich with notes of spice and molasses, the rum adds both a depth of flavor and enhances the double decker look.",
			"Falernum is another key element in the Autumn Wind. Similar to orgeat, this syrup is generally flavored with ginger, lime, almond, cloves and allspice. Often referred to as velvet falernum\u2014including by its most popular producer, John D. Taylor\u2019s Velvet Falernum\u2014it can be made as either a low-proof liqueur or a non-alcoholic syrup.

The Shoulda Benne Pirate comes from Harold\u2019s Cabin in Charleston, South Carolina, a historic market, bar and restaurant that has existed in some form or another since the 1920s. The cocktail, too, is rooted in history, as it takes a crumble of benne seed wafers, a South Carolina low country staple, for a unique, crunchy garnish. The dessert is toasted benne seed\u2014otherwise known as sesame seeds\u2014on a thin caramel wafer. Salted, toasty and crisp, the cookies can be hard to find outside of South Carolina, but if you\u2019re intent on authenticity, you can always order some online or try your hand at baking some yourself. Otherwise, some thin sesame wafers can fill in.",

Founded as Charleston\u2019s first distillery since prohibition, Striped Pig is renowned for its sustainability, with such efforts including sourcing local sugarcane for its rum. However, its availability is mostly limited to the Palmetto State, so those who want to make the Shoulda Benne Pirate but can\u2019t get their hands on the real deal can substitute another high quality white rum; after the strawberry infusion, it shouldn\u2019t taste dramatically different.",

The egg white gives it a creamy, silky mouthfeel that accentuates its richness without adding additional sugar.

Jamaican rum brings earthy funk, gold demerara gives the drink a rich backbone and white rum lends it brightness and fruit notes.",

The major difference in using this kind of juicer instead of a modern-style hand juicer is that the lime half is hollowed out while maintaining its shape, whereas the hinge-style hand juicers of today will flip the shell inside-out. The idea here is to render a nice half-shell suitable for garnishing. Lastly, don\u2019t shake the lime shell with the drink as it will impart unwanted bitterness.",
			"In addition, Cate advises bartenders to experiment with rums when making Mai Tais. In his words, this drink is \u201cthe perfect foil for a huge variety of rums.\u201d He also specifies in the book that the Trader Vic\u2019s original recipe called for 100% pot-still rum with significant age, so bear that in mind when developing your own interpretation.",
			"Fun fact: Trader Vic never served a Mai Tai with a rum float. This style was added sometime over the course of the drink\u2019s evolution between 1944 and now. Cate notes that a Mai Tai served with a float of overproof Demerara rum is referred to as the \u201cOld Way,\u201d a moniker stemming from an elderly Trader Vic\u2019s regular who preferred his Mai Tais this way."

			"The Mai Tai is one of the most famous Tiki drinks in the world. Composed of rum, orange cura\u00e7ao, fresh lime juice and orgeat (a nuanced almond syrup), it\u2019s held sway over cocktail enthusiasts and Tiki aficionados for decades. It even enjoyed a star turn in the Elvis film \u201cBlue Hawaii.\u201d",
			"Victor \u201cTrader Vic\u201d Bergeron is often credited with inventing the drink at his Trader Vic\u2019s bar in the 1940s, though it\u2019s likely that Donn Beach laid the groundwork for the famous recipe during the 1930s at his Don the Beachcomber bar. The original Trader Vic\u2019s recipe featured Jamaica\u2019s J. Wray & Nephew rum. Once Bergeron ran out of his supply, he moved to blending rums in an attempt to create a similar flavor profile.",
			"While the Mai Tai was created as a way to showcase the flavors of good-quality rum, it took a wrong turn over the decades as bartenders employed bottled juices and mixers. Those yielded neon-colored or overly sweet cocktails. Fortunately, a renewed interest in Tiki cocktails has returned the Mai Tai to prominence as a fresh, balanced, rum-forward cocktail.",
			"Today\u2019s bartenders continue the tradition of blending rums, aiming to find the optimal combination of flavor, depth and complexity. Some barkeeps utilize a crisp white rum alongside a dark overproof rum. Others play with high-ester Jamaican rums and grassy rhum agricole. There isn\u2019t one right answer, but it\u2019s helpful to consider four traits when creating your own rum blend: ABV, age, production methods and the raw materials used to make the rum. Find harmony in the details, and you might create the next great Mai Tai.",
			"Once the drink is shaken and served over ice (crushed is best), it\u2019s time for the garnish. Go wild, if you\u2019re feeling creative. Some Mai Tais feature everything from pineapple wedges to cherries on top. But if you\u2019d like to keep the presentation cool and classic, a lime wheel and mint spring are a fine choice.",

Happy to oblige, the barkeep replaced that water with gin, assembling the drink in equal parts and forever improving the world\u2019s drinks repertoire.",
			"The classic Negroni was predominately enjoyed in Italy for decades, but it eventually found its way to American shores during the craft cocktail resurgence in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The bitter palate pleaser is great the way it was originally concocted, but like many great cocktails, it has proved to be a popular riffing point for bartenders. One obvious way to tweak the Negroni is by swapping the gin for another base spirit\u2014in this case mezcal. The mezcal-spiked drink was popularized by cocktail bars and agave-focused spots like Mayahuel in New York, and the cocktail quickly assumed its place on the alter of modern-classics.",
			"The Mezcal Negroni is a seemingly simple take on the classic, but subbing the agave spirit for gin creates a drink that is a significant departure from the original. Mezcal imbues the cocktail with earthy, savory and smoky qualities. Though a stark contrast to the dry, botanical character of gin, mezcal is similarly effective in a Negroni due to its assertive character, which goes head-to-head with the bitter Campari and herbal vermouth.",
			"The Mezcal Negroni, made with equal parts of each ingredient and stirred with ice, is easy to make and a fun deviation from the standard recipe. Try making it yourself, and see how one simple tweak creates a whole new cocktail."

			"Using genever in place of gin when making a Negroni not only brings the juniper, but also a bodied maltiness to the cocktail classic. For those unfamiliar, genever is essentially the Dutch grandfather of gin. Made from malted grain and flavored with juniper, this age-old spirit is known for its earthy, nutty qualities. New York City bartender and beverage consultant Paula Lukas elaborates: \u201cReplacing the traditional gin in a Negroni with genever gives it a mellow, malty flavor. Genever tastes very similar to unaged whisky, and brings a certain warmth to the cocktail.\u201d",
			"Christopher M. Gonzalez, a bartender at the Jonathan Club in Los Angeles, California, shares his perspective on genever as a Negroni base: \u201cGenever will take you to a new place of refreshingly sweet smoothness. In combination with [smaller proportions of] Campari and sweet vermouth, you are allowing the genever to come forward and blend magically in true form,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want the best experience, choose your sweet vermouth wisely, and try different brands closest to your liking\u2014there are many great classic versions and some great craft spirit brands coming out.\u201d",
			"All in all, the use of genever here brings a roundness to this classic drink that helps to offset the signature bitterness of Campari, making the Dutch Negroni an excellent alternative for those who love this style of drink but feel it could use some softening. Here\u2019s how to make the perfect one at home."

		"name": "Martinez",
		"description": [
			"The cocktail world owes a lot to the classic Martinez. Made with equal parts gin and sweet vermouth, plus maraschino liqueur and bitters, this old-school variation of the Manhattan went on to inspire the first Martinis and then the Dry Martini as we know it today.",
			"The origins of the Martinez are unclear. It\u2019s possible that legendary bartender and author Jerry Thomas may have invented the cocktail for a customer traveling to the port city of Martinez, California. The city of Martinez, however, insists that a local bartender concocted the drink. This mystery is best pondered over a good cocktail, and we\u2019re betting you know precisely the one.",
			"What is certain is that the Martinez made its first print appearance in the 1884 book, \u201cThe Modern Bartender\u2019s Guide\u201d by O.H. Byron. But it\u2019s likely that the cocktail predated the book by a decade or more. This recipe did not specify which type of gin should be used, but given the preference and availability of Dutch genever at the time, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that it featured this malty style of gin. (English gin had not yet assumed its throne in America.)",
			"The Martinez appeared again in 1887, when it was included in the posthumously published edition of \u201cThe Bar-Tender\u2019s Guide\u201d by Thomas. In this version, the recipe specifically called for Old Tom gin, a spirit that lands somewhere between malt-heavy genever and juniper-heavy London dry gin. Over the years, other Martinez recipes called for dry vermouth instead of sweet, or the addition of cura\u00e7ao, but Thomas\u2019 recipe most resembles the Martinez served today.",
			"Experimenting with gins is a fun way to tweak the recipe. London dry gin will produce a more bracing drink, while modern styles can create a more pronounced citrusy or floral flavor, depending on the bottle. If you want to hew as closely as possible to the traditional recipe, make your drink with Old Tom gin.",
			"When stirred with ice, the cocktail\u2019s ingredients blend into a rich package laced with soft juniper, herbal vermouth and the dry cherry notes of maraschino liqueur. The Martinez is part Manhattan, part Martini, and entirely delicious."

			"The Bronx is an interesting historical cocktail. While it\u2019s not as famous as its two close relatives, the Manhattan or the Martini, it does deserve a place in the cocktail hall of fame along with them, thanks to its unique balance of sweet, tart, botanical and boozy.",
			"Like many pre-Prohibition cocktails, the origin of the Bronx is up for debate. However, this debate is less fiery than others, with the generally accepted story attributing its creation to one Johnny Solon (also spelled Solan), a bartender at the famous Astoria-Waldorf Hotel in New York. Reportedly, Solon created the drink sometime in the early 1900s, though an precise date is unknown. According to bartender legend Gary Regan, Solon named it the Bronx after visiting the Bronx Zoo, which opened in 1899. Cocktail historian David Wondrich, in his book \u201cImbibe,\u201d reports some conflicting origins, including two bartenders in the Bronx itself who have been attributed with the cocktail\u2019s creation.",
			"The drink is, essentially, a Perfect Martini (that is, a Martini that uses equal parts sweet and dry vermouth) with a bit of orange juice and some orange bitters. This particular recipe is perhaps why the drink hasn\u2019t enjoyed the robust legacy of its similar whiskey counterpart also named for a New York City borough. Orange juice is not as popular an ingredient in cocktails as lime, lemon or even grapefruit juice, lacking the intense, concentrated bite of those other citrus fruits. This leads to the Bronx being considered anemic at times, especially compared to the potent elixir of whiskey and vermouth, or the elegance of the Martini\u2019s proportions. According to Wondrich, the Bronx was once criticized in a 1913 play, where a character was referred to as being \u201cas weak as a Bronx Cocktail.\u201d",
			"But it has its fans. Unlike the Martini or Manhattan, the addition of orange juice gives this gin drink a refreshing, summertime quality. It also means it\u2019s less out of place at the brunch table than other spirit-forward drinks. For some drinkers the Bronx could replace the Mimosa, at least to mix things up from time to time.",
			"The Bronx is a drink that relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients. Using a nice, freshly squeezed orange for juice will result in a brighter, fresher drink than using store-bought orange juice. Likewise, a bottom-shelf gin will make a mediocre version of the Bronx, while citrus-forward gins like Tanqueray No. 10 or Hendrick\u2019s will magnify the bright and quenching aspect of the cocktail."

			"When it comes to staples of the cocktail world, it\u2019s hard to be more iconic than the Sazerac. This classic New Orleans drink is at least 150 years old, and possibly closer to 200, though, as with many drinks, the history can get fuzzy. While first made with French brandy, it switched over to calling for rye whiskey after phylloxera devastated French wine crops in the late 19th century.",
			"A Sazerac is recognizable by those with bar knowhow, as it\u2019s served up, but in a chilled Old Fashioned or rocks glass with no garnish or ice rather than traditional stemware. That\u2019s not the case with the Bananarac. This Sazerac variation comes from Natasha David, a star bartender and founder of New York City\u2019s now-closed Nitecap as well as You and Me Cocktails, a bar consulting company. Beyond adding ice, David adds a rather unexpected ingredient: banana, in the form of Giffard Banane du Br\u00e9sil liqueur.",
			"Rather than decide between rye whiskey and brandy for the base, David opts for a blend of both, a technique that should be familiar to fans of the Sazerac. In particular, she uses Old Overholt\u2014a popular and affordable quality rye whiskey\u2014and Tariquet VSOP Armagnac. The brandy here is on the pricey side, around $70 in most markets. Like with any drink, it is possible to substitute a little less expensive bottle for a more affordable final drink.",
			"The banana element, on the other hand, has no easy substitutions. Giffard Banane du Br\u00e9sil liqueur is a singular product, and while there are other banana liqueurs, few of them are of the same quality as the rich, fruity liqueur made with macerated bananas and spiked with cognac. There\u2019s only a half-ounce in the drink, but it comes through with gentle assertiveness. It adds a unique element without overwhelming the flavor profile with strident banana-notes.",
			"Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a Sazerac without bitters, but David holds off on the Peychaud\u2019s Bitters that give the traditional Sazerac its signature ruby hue. Instead, she uses a single dash of The Bitter Truth Old Time aromatic bitters."

			"The Sazerac, which is a close cousin to the Old Fashioned, has been kicking around in one form or another since as early as 1838 (with other reports pegging its invention closer to the late-1800s) and was trademarked in 1900 by Sazerac Co. The Sazerac was crowned the official cocktail of New Orleans in 2008, a designation more suited to marketers than drink mixers. The truth is the Sazerac has always belonged to the Crescent City.",
			"It is believed that the first Sazeracs were made with French brandy\u2014Sazerac de Forge et Fils, to be exact. And it\u2019s known that those first Sazeracs contained Peychaud\u2019s bitters, a bright-red concoction with flavors of gentian and anise that was invented by New Orleans resident Antoine Peychaud. Add some sugar and a dash of absinthe, and you have a strong, aromatic drink that embodies the city from whence it hails.",
			"Eventually, that French brandy was replaced with American rye whiskey, a spirit that grew in both popularity and availability during the 19th century. Brandy or cognac, which are distilled from grapes, yield a Sazerac that is fruity and floral, different than today\u2019s rye-based versions, which feature the grain spirit\u2019s trademark spice notes.",
			"A well-made rye Sazerac is indeed a tasty cocktail, full of kick and depth, though perhaps a hair too much muscle. That\u2019s why this recipe combines equal parts cognac and rye, not as a gestural homage to a lost classic but because the two work together so perfectly. The opposing pairing, when accented by the licorice flavors of absinthe, produces a cocktail that\u2019s simultaneously soft and bold, smooth and brash\u2014and unmistakably New Orleans."

		"description": [
			"New Orleans is famous for many things: Mardi Gras, beignets, gumbo, the Superdome. But perhaps nothing is more famous among drinks aficionados than the Sazerac, a classic cocktail consisting of rye whiskey, absinthe, sugar and bitters. The exact birthdate of the cocktail is elusive, and purported to be anytime between the 1830s and the late-1800s. For decades, the Sazerac was primarily a New Orleans drink, and even today, it\u2019s regarded as the official cocktail of Louisiana. But it has proliferated during the modern cocktail era, and now it can be found in bars all over the world.",
			"Many believe that the first Sazerac called for cognac, a spirit that was prevalent in French-influenced New Orleans during the 1800s. A\u00a0cognac called Sazerac-de-Forge-et-Fils was served at the original Sazerac Coffee House, and Antoine Peychaud (inventor of the cocktail\u2019s necessary Peychaud\u2019s bitters) was known to enjoy combining his bitters with French brandy.",
			"It\u2019s possible that phylloxera, the 19th century vine-rotting epidemic that upended Europe\u2019s wine trade, resulted in rye whiskey supplanting cognac in the cocktail. It\u2019s possible that New Orleans\u2019 residents simply substituted their preferred spirit into the drink. It\u2019s also conceivable that Sazeracs were always made with rye whiskey, not brandy, and that well-intentioned claims to the contrary are based on incorrect intel. Regardless of the hard-to-trace history or how the potential liquor swap occurred, this much is certain: The cognac version has its charms.",
			"Distilled from grapes, cognac produces a different Sazerac than grain-based rye whiskey. While rye lends its trademark spice notes to the drink, cognac moves the flavor profile in a fruity and floral direction. Both versions are equally strong, provided that you\u2019re using spirits of similar proof, and each allows the fiercely aromatic absinthe to shine.",
			"This recipe was shared by bartending legend Gary Regan. Try making it yourself, and see the difference. Better yet, make a couple Sazeracs side by side, one with cognac and one with rye whiskey. Only then can you crown a champion."

			"New Orleans has played a significant role in cocktail culture over the past century-plus. The City That Care Forgot has been responsible for classics like the Sazerac and Ramos Gin Fizz. Its contributions also include the Vieux Carr\u00e9, which was first stirred to life during the 1930s by Walter Bergeron, a bartender at New Orleans\u2019 legendary Carousel Bar inside the Hotel Monteleone. Vieux Carr\u00e9 means \u201cold square\u201d in French and refers to the city\u2019s French Quarter neighborhood.",
			"Like so many classic cocktails from that city, the recipe represents the crosscurrents of America at the time: brandy and liqueur from France, vermouth from Italy, and rye whiskey from just up the Mississippi. The Vieux Carr\u00e9 is at once boozy, sweet, bitter and smooth\u2014in other words, it\u2019s New Orleans in a glass.",
			"The drink features several strong ingredients. In most cases, rye or cognac could carry a cocktail on their own, but the Vieux Carr\u00e9 calls for both in a split-base technique that allows each component to shine. The rye provides muscular spice, while the cognac lends softer notes of fruit and florals. Sweet vermouth adds rich botanicals, while B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine brings its distinct flavors of herbs, spices and honey. Finally, the bitters add structure and seasoning. Each element has a role to play; when combined, the ingredients meld seamlessly.",
			"This recipe comes from legendary bartender Dale DeGroff, aka King Cocktail. He subs the classic combination of Angostura and Peychaud\u2019s bitters for his own pimento aromatic bitters, which bring similar accents of baking spices and anise to the drink. He also chooses George Dickel rye from Tennessee. But any good rye whiskey will do the job, so feel free to experiment with your favorite bottle.",
			"Today the Vieux Carr\u00e9 can be found on cocktail menus across the country, alongside other New Orleans classics like the Sazerac. If you find yourself in the French Quarter, don\u2019t pass up a chance to drink one straight from the source. The cocktail is potent, but note that the Carousel Bar is famous for its revolving bar.

From Chicago bartender Charles Joly\u2014the founder of Crafthouse Cocktails, a line of bottled cocktails\u2014the drink uses Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth and a mix of allspice liqueur and simple syrup for sweetness. The result is a foamy, rich and silky drink that, when made right, is as stunning to look at as it is to drink.",

			"Even more so than with an egg white drink, a flip benefits from what\u2019s known in the industry as a dry shake. For that, simply build the cocktail as normal in the shaker, but omit the ice for the time being. After a vigorous shaking to build up the foam, add the ice and shake again until well-chilled, and double strain using a handheld strainer into your awaiting chilled vessel.

			"Tonic is most often associated as a mixer for gin and vodka, but you don\u2019t have to let those classic choices have all the fun. Rum, tequila and even brandy can all be combined with tonic for a quick infusion of effervescence and flavor.",
			"Elana Abt, a wine director and sommelier, created the Summer Tonic while working at the now-closed Otto in New York. She wanted to add a rum-based cocktail to the menu but keep the refreshing Gin & Tonic in mind. \u201cRum just feels like summer, and my guests typically order more rum cocktails this time of year,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, \u2018Why not create a cool rum version of the classic G&T.\u2019\u201d",
			"And that\u2019s exactly what she did, beginning with richly flavored Mount Gay rum from Barbados. She paired that with Borgia Bitter Rosso, a bright-red aperitif flavored with\u00a0gentian flower and gentian root. This unique liqueur acts like Campari and other bitter red liqueurs when mixed into drinks, so if you can\u2019t find Borgia, you can try a substitute for similar results. Fresh lemon juice adds bright citrusy balance, and Fever-Tree aromatic tonic water brings a vivid little extra to the cocktail. Its pink color is courtesy of South American angostura bark, and its aromatic botanicals include cardamom, pimento berry and ginger, lending spiced notes that differentiate it from the typical citrus-forward profile of most tonics.",

Some swap out gin for another spirit, like the Mezcal Negroni, while others tweak the Campari or vermouth\u2014think White Negroni. For his Stranger in the Alps cocktail, Nashville bartender Matthew Tocco charts his own path, sticking with the holy trinity of gin, Campari and vermouth but adding two unique additions to the equation: an Oregon brandy and an Italian alpine liqueur.",
			"Tocco begins by rinsing a glass with Clear Creek Douglas Fir brandy, which adds just a hint of flavor and fragrance to the drink. The distillery describes its brandy as \u201ca tree in a bottle\u201d and makes it by infusing fresh Douglas fir buds in eau de vie, giving the spirit a kick of green, herbal flavors and aromas. Tocco also calls upon Braulio Amaro, which is made from a recipe of more than 20 mountain herbs and botanicals, including gentian, juniper, peppermint, star anise and wormwood. It\u2019s delightfully bitter, with a cooling hit of pine and menthol.",
			"While the classic Negroni uses equal parts gin, vermouth and Campari, Tocco dials up the gin, ensuring that it can stand tall alongside the rich vermouth and one-two punch of bitter liqueurs.

			"Gin isn\u2019t for everyone, and neither is a bracing, bitter cocktail like the Negroni. However, for those looking to try a new drink that resembles a Negroni, with a spirit similar to gin, but is its own unique concoction, then the Wormhole Warrior is a good starting place.",
			"The base of this cocktail is Cocalero Cl\u00e1sico Herbal Spirit, a rare spirit that shares some similarities with gin, notably a strong botanical presence that includes juniper. This bottling, though, is milder, has lower alcohol and isn\u2019t nearly as juniper-forward, incorporating instead botanicals from South America.",
			"Cocalero is named after the coca leaf growers of Peru and Bolivia, whose indigenous people have used the leaf for medicinal and religious purposes for thousands of years. Like Green Chartreuse, cocalero is made with a closely guarded secret recipe; this one includes 17 botanicals, a number of which would not be out of place in an energy drink, like green tea, ginger, guarana and ginseng. Given its namesake, it might come as no surprise that the spirit also includes coca leaves. In this product, the coca flavors are extracted using a steam-distillation method developed by the perfume industry, and the spirit contains no narcotic elements.",
			"If viewing the Wormhole Warrior as a Negroni variation, then Tempus Fugit Gran Classico Bitter takes the role of Campari. Like Campari, Gran Classico is a bittersweet Italian aperitif, though its color and flavor profile are different\u2014this amber hued liqueur has notes of rhubarb, orange peel, gentian and wormwood. Because of its soft colors and bittersweet flavor, it\u2019s often used in place of Campari for golden or blanc Negronis. Rather than the traditional ratio of 1-1-1, though, this recipe calls for only 3/4 ounce of the bold and gold liqueur.",
			"The relative sweetness of both the Cocalero and the Gran Classico means that rather than using a sweet vermouth (which the classic Negroni calls for), a dry vermouth is used. Not only does it keep the drink from being overly sweet, but also gives it a clearer, brighter color. The choice of which dry vermouth you employ is up to your personal taste preferences and price point concerns, but Dolin Dry Vermouth is a reliable, affordable choice. The vermouth also goes nicely in a proper Dry Martini, for when you\u2019re done making Wormhole Warriors."

One relatively minor change sounds strange in its description, but one sip and you\u2019ll see why New York City bartending expert Pam Wiznitzer puts cold brew coffee into her take on the Milanese staple.",
			"Rather than adding coffee to the cocktail as a separate ingredient, Wiznitzer infuses cold brew into the crimson Campari liqueur that defines the Negroni. The infusion is versatile\u2014a quick infusion of ten minutes will add subtle but noticeable coffee notes, but you can infuse up to 24-hours for a more robust coffee presence.",
			"A coffee-infused Negroni certainly sounds odd\u2014coffee and gin aren\u2019t as commonly associated as coffee and whiskey, for instance. However, the sweet silkiness of the cold brew mellows some of the Negroni\u2019s rougher edges, and its inherent chocolate notes meld beautifully with the botanicals of the Campari and sweet vermouth. It\u2019s an elegant, slightly caffeinated take on the drink, and may even convert naysayers of Italy\u2019s favorite three-ingredient concoction.",

It would fit beautifully in a bourbon-based Boulevardier, as the whiskey is a natural pairing with coffee. The Roman Holiday is like a caffeinated Jungle Bird, and you could use the cold brew Campari to punch up its coffee notes. Or, you can simply enjoy it as a highball, with club soda and ice, or add an ounce of sweet vermouth for a cold brew Americano."

The drink comes from bartending icon Ivy Mix, owner of the New York City bar Leyenda and founder of the feminist bartending competition Speed-Rack. One of the most salient changes is to the base spirit: rather than the rum traditionally used in a Jungle Bird, Mix substitutes some of it for Torres 15 brandy, a well-regarded and reasonably priced Spanish brandy. However, there\u2019s still a splash of rum in the drink: half an ounce of any Jamaican rum you\u2019d want to use.",

Much like its crimson predecessor, Contratto Bitter is bittersweet, crimson and heavily botanical, infused with orange peel, cardamom, gentian, juniper berries, mint, ginger, rhubarb and sage.",

The texture won\u2019t contain that trademark icy bite with each sip, but the flavor will be nearly identical.",

It\u2019s fun to get creative when making Daiquiris, but it\u2019s important to hit the produce aisle before starting the blender. Because as easy as those pre-mixed pouches may be, they can\u2019t simulate the refreshing taste of real fruit."

The tropical drink\u2014part Strawberry Daiquiri, part Pi\u00f1a Colada, separated in the glass\u2014precedes the popular \u201980s television drama by some years. Still, the cocktail evokes serious Miami vibes, from the name to the presentation.",
			"Since its inception, the Miami Vice has typically been found in two places: nightclubs and beach bars. Even as the sweet, frozen drink heyday of the \u201980s and \u201990s has waned, tropical drinks continue to dominate beaches and resort hotels for good reason\u2014they\u2019re fun, delicious reminders that you\u2019re on vacation.",
			"To make the Miami Vice, you need to make two separate cocktails. The Strawberry Daiquiri calls for rum, lime juice, simple syrup and fresh strawberries. All that is blended with crushed ice until smooth. Then, you make a Pi\u00f1a Colada, which consists of rum, pineapple juice and cream of coconut. That, too, gets mixed with crushed ice and blended until smooth.",
			"Now that you have two drinks at your disposal, you, of course, combine them. Whichever order you choose will taste great, but the typical presentation involves red at the bottom and white up top, so you pour the Strawberry Daiquiri into the glass first, followed by the Pi\u00f1a Colada. The layered effect creates a striking visual and gives the drinker a choose-your-own-adventure situation. Sip from the bottom, and you\u2019ll taste mostly Daiquiri. Sip from the top, and it\u2019s all coconut-y. Mix them together, and enjoy the synergistic blend created by two of the world\u2019s most popular tropical cocktails. There are no wrong answers here.",
			"That said, you may feel tempted to set the blender blades spinning with ready-made mixes. Resist that urge. If you stick to fresh fruits, freshly squeezed juice and good rum, your Miami Vice will be a runaway hit, both in taste and appearance. Yes, just like the television show famous for its white jackets, V-necks and loafers."

Otherwise, aim for an option that limits the artificial ingredients.",

Pair that rum with fresh lime juice, because fresh is the best. And, although simple syrup works fine, demerara syrup\u2014which is made from a type of raw cane sugar\u2014brings notes of toffee and molasses.",

			"Outside of a Spanish or Irish Coffee, caffeinated beverages in cocktails may seem like a strange concept, especially for cold drinks. The rising popularity of cold brew, however, sees more marriages between coffee and spirits of all kinds. One such spirit that inherently lends itself to mixing with coffee comes from the same part of the world: rum. Add to that another tropical fruit, the banana, and you have an unconventional yet delicious drink that tastes like a boozy breakfast in a glass.",
			"\u201cThe Midnight Oil brings to life in cocktail form one of my all-time favorite snack combos: a morning coffee and a slice or two of banana bread,\u201d says bartender Brett Esler of Whisler\u2019s in Austin, the creator of the Midnight Oil. \u201cWith an aged rum base, a touch of the Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur for a little depth and some vanilla extract to round it out, you have yourself a slightly caffeinated, fall-driven sipper.\u201d",
			"For the aged rum, Esler opts for Mount Gay Black Barrel; while its name may spark some confusion, the rum is golden, not blackstrap like the rum in a Dark \u2019n Stormy. Robust, bold and smooth, it\u2019s an elegant Barbados rum for use in both cocktails and for drinking neat. If substituting, be sure to use an aged rum of similar quality, rather than opting for a lower shelf variety.",

The lauded Portland, Oregon, based coffee company now sells its bottled cold brew nationwide, as well as online, which makes it an easy ingredient to find. However, those who want to use a different brand, or who feel compelled to make their own, should feel free to play.",
			"Two of the other ingredients in the drink are less flexible. While there are other ginger liqueurs, Domaine de Canton is by far the most well known and its flavor is particular, so switching it for something else would alter the drink. Similarly, while there are a few banana liqueurs on the market, many of them are cloying and artificial, unlike Giffard Banane du Br\u00e9sil liqueur, which sees macerated bananas from Brazil mixed with a touch of cognac.

			"As a self-professed avid coffee geek, Moik has had his fair share of Espresso & Tonics. The refreshing, caffeinated beverage acted as the starting point for the Nightcap, which sees the addition of rum and syrup to add some kick and sweetness. The rum, a gold rum from Goslings, has notes of butterscotch and vanilla but finishes dry. Maple syrup adds sweetness, Angostura bitters lend complexity, and orange zest matches the tonic\u2019s citrus notes.",
			"While Goslings is primarily known for its black strap rum that serves as the base for a proper Dark & Stormy, the Nightcap calls for the Gold Seal, a newer expression. Brighter and softer than the Black Strap, the Bermudian rum pairs with the gentle bittersweetness of the cold-brew coffee.",
			"Grade A maple syrup is another necessary ingredient in the drink. Harvested earlier in the season, grade A indicates a lighter amber color. Grade B refers to a darker, more robust syrup, which could potentially overwhelm in the Nightcap. Moik uses San Pellegrino tonic water in his highball, but any high quality tonic water will serve well in the drink, just be sure to taste for your flavor profile preference.",

Too much gin, and the botanical spirit will overshadow the unique qualities of the tonic. Too much tonic, and it will drown the gin.",
			"There is endless room for experimentation within those two ingredients. With hundreds of gins on the market and dozens of tonics, a good G&T is a mix-and-match exercise to find the combination that best suits your tastes. London dry gins are characterized by their juniper-forward flavor profile; modern-style gins often dial down the juniper and ramp up the citrus and florals. Some tonics are dry and straightforward, with prominent notes of bitter quinine. Others are sweet and syrupy. And in between, you\u2019ll find tonics featuring everything from citrus and aromatics to herbs and spice. Then, of course, there\u2019s the garnish. Many people swear by a lime. Others choose a lemon, and still others prefer a grapefruit slice or rosemary sprig, or a seasonal garnish such as blood orange and thyme.",
			"All those permutations results in a bevy of Gin & Tonics, so naturally, the drink lends itself to creativity. Muddled cucumbers or fruit provide an extra dose of refreshment, and a measure of dry vermouth softens the cocktail. Liqueurs, fresh herbs and even barrel-aged gin are all fair game when you\u2019re making G&Ts.

			"One of the more thrilling things about the current global bartending scene is the proliferation and spread of once-obscure liqueurs throughout the world. Take Becherovka, for instance. The herbal, botanical liqueur has been a native spirit of the Czech Republic since 1805, technically longer than the independent country itself has even been around. Despite its vaunted history, however, exports of the liqueur were severely restricted until recent years, with Pernod-Ricard launching the product in the United States starting in 2011. And while it is available now state-side, it\u2019s still much more popular in the Czech Republic than anywhere in the U.S. \u201cEveryone here, young or old, male or female, has some experience with Becherovka,\u201d says Filip Str\u00e1nsk\u00fd of the\u00a0AnonymouS\u00a0concept bars in Prague. \u201cPeople drink it to celebrate and to mourn and to toast highs and lows. It\u2019s part of our history.\u201d",
			"The arrival Becherovka in the states brought with it the Beton, the signature highball of Prague. \u201cWe drink Becherovka in a traditional drink called the Beton, which was first published in 1967,\u201d\u00a0 Str\u00e1nsk\u00fd says. \u201cIt\u2019s a twist on a Gin & Tonic.\u201d Like the iconic G&T, the Beton is a simple concoction, just Becherovka, tonic water, and a wedge of lemon rather than lime. But also like the Gin & Tonic, its sum eclipses its parts, as the tonic water brings out the unique elements of the Czech liqueur. Notes of cinnamon, ginger and licorice mingle with the quinine bittersweetness of the tonic water for a refreshing, bracing highball.",
			"However, for those who want to add even more complexity and botanicals to the drink, there is precedence with a slight variation to the Beton. \u00a0\u201c...because we love a bitter taste, we are also adding\u00a0Aperitiv KV14,\u201d says Str\u00e1nsk\u00fd. \u201cAdd this [to the tonic highball] and you have a Beton Bitter.\u201d KV14 is an offshoot product in the Becherovka portfolio\u2014red-hued, clocking in at 40 % ABV and more potently bitter with no sugar added. A splash atop your Beton goes a long way to transforming the drink. However, KV14 is definitely not nearly as available as Becherovka in most markets, and the uniqueness of the liqueur means there\u2019s no clear substitute. Because of this, you may have to do make do with the Beton, rather than the Beton Bitter, but one sip and you\u2019ll know there\u2019s nothing wrong with that."

			"Gin and tonic were made for one another, and the classic combination has been around for centuries. It all seems simple enough\u2014the essential ingredients are right there in the name.",
			"According to Los Angeles bartender and Candra co-founder Sebastian Hamilton-Mudge, a good Pink Gin & Tonic (and any other gin & tonic, for that matter) should be light, crisp and refreshing, and should generally be garnished with fresh citrus. What sets this rosy riff apart is the addition of Angostura, which adds balancing bitterness to any drink along with a layer of complex baking spice. In this use, it also provides that lovely pink hue. The Pink Gin & Tonic is not only easy to make but brings a fresh, nuanced flavor profile to the classic recipe.",
			"The genius combination\u2014and delightful coloring\u2014of bitters and gin has withstood the test of time. \u201c[Pink gin] goes back to sometime after 1830 when British Royal Naval sailors got their hands on it and mixed it with gin onboard ship to combat seasickness,\u201d Hamilton-Mudge shares. The gin of the era was Plymouth gin, which is a somewhat sweeter style than the citrus-forward London Dry category, but you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself which gin is best for your G&T.",
			"For a full-on English experience, Hamilton-Mudge has a pairing suggestion for your next Pink G&T: \u201cFor me, [this drink] comes into its own when served with British-style fish and chips. It\u2019s one of the most deliciously simple food pairings you can get your hands on\u2014the light, refreshing citrusy notes along with a bitter finish pairs and cuts through the richness of the dish perfectly.\u201d Whether you follow Hamilton-Mudge\u2019s lead or enjoy this cocktail on its own, there\u2019s no wrong way to do it."

			"If you order a Gin & Tonic at a bar, your drink will most likely come garnished with a lime or lemon wedge. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that classic option, as it can be squeezed into the cocktail for a citrusy kick or dropped in for a more subtle effect per the drinker\u2019s preference. However, the G&T\u2019s accompaniment doesn\u2019t have to stop at basic citrus fruits.",
			"All throughout Spain, and particularly in Basque Country, it\u2019s common to see Gin & Tonics garnished with all manner of ingredients and combinations. The key is considering every component of the drink to ensure they work in harmony.",
			"London dry gins are very juniper-forward, and they vary significantly from modern-style gins, especially those featuring more citrusy and floral flavor profiles. When choosing your garnish, you can elect to highlight the flavors already in the gin, or add flavors that are absent from the gin. The same rule applies to the tonic water. Not every tonic is the same, as the quinine-and-botanical-laced beverage varies in sweetness, bitterness and herbal notes. So, your garnish should also work in concert with your tonic.",
			"This recipe features juniper berries, a lemon wheel and thyme, but you can experiment with seasonal fruits and herbs to find the best combination for your own tastes. Other good garnish options include lime wheels, rosemary, lavender, a vanilla bean pod, sliced peaches, berries and even saffron\u2014all ingredients that you\u2019re likely to see when drinking in Spain.",
			"The Spanish G&T can be served in a rocks glass or highball glass, but it\u2019s traditionally served in a copa de balon, also known as a balloon glass. The wide-mouthed wine glass not only looks good\u2014it allows you to pack in more garnishes, and it highlights the drink\u2019s aromatics with each sip.",
			"Remember to use a good bottle of freshly opened tonic whenever possible. A soda gun can work in a pinch, especially if you\u2019re at a bar and that\u2019s the only game in town. But it\u2019s more likely that the tonic will be overly sweet or lacking carbonation when it comes from a gun. Good bottled tonics like Fever-Tree, Q Tonic and East Imperial source quality ingredients and offer a variety of options featuring different flavor profiles, which helps to ensure that your Spanish Gin & Tonic journey is a successful one."

The story parallels that of the Moscow Mule, in which the genesis of the recipe was to promote and sell a boozy ingredient, in this case blue cura\u00e7ao.",

After experimenting with several different versions, he settled on one that shook (or blended, depending on guest preference) vodka, light rum, cura\u00e7ao, pineapple juice and sweet-and-sour mix, served in a tall glass garnished with a pineapple and a cherry.",

An icon of a bygone era, the city\u2019s cable cars are the last remaining manually operated cable car systems in the country and still climb the hills of San Francisco, carrying tourists and commuters (though mostly tourists) up and down the busy streets.",
			"Whether or not one is familiar with the drink\u2019s namesake, you\u2019ll likely appreciate this rum sour for its sweet, tart and lightly spiced flavors. Essentially an adaptation of the Sidecar, the Cable Car swaps the brandy for spiced rum, an uncommon ingredient in cocktails but a welcome change during the late 1990s. In an era defined by the Appletini and Cosmopolitan, Abou-Ganim\u2019s innovative drinks helped define San Francisco as a worthy cocktail destination and as a trendsetting locale.",
			"At the time of the Cable Car\u2019s creation, Captain Morgan was likely the most available label for spiced rum. While today it\u2019s still the most famous of the category\u2014besides maybe Kraken\u2014the Captain has plenty of competition. Both Cruzan and Bacardi make inexpensive and serviceable spiced rums\u2014neither of them break $15 in most markets but they both work well in cocktails. For a more indulgent approach, Chairman\u2019s Reserve from Saint Lucia, Boukman Botanical Rhum from Haiti and Don Q Oak Barrel Spiced Rum from Puerto Rico are all stellar spiced rums and range from $30 to $50 a bottle.",
			"Similar to a Sidecar or Brandy Crusta, the Cable Car includes an orange liqueur in addition to simple syrup for sweetness\u2014specifically, orange cura\u00e7ao. However, using something like Bol\u2019s will lead to a more cloying drink, and it\u2019s best to instead use a dry cura\u00e7ao; Abou-Ganim uses Marie Brizard orange cura\u00e7ao, an elegant blend of bitter oranges from Haiti and sweet-orange zest from Spain. A strong alternative is Pierre Ferrand Dry Cura\u00e7ao\u2014crafted in collaboration with cocktail historian David Wondrich, it\u2019s a complex and botanical citrus liqueur macerated with brandy. Other orange liqueurs like Cointreau or Grand Marnier will also make a stunning drink.",

The Bunny Mary\u2014created by bartender Rob Krueger while working at the now-closed Extra Fancy in New York City\u2014gets its playful name and vibrant hue from carrot juice, punched up with savory caper brine and a spicy cayenne-and-paprika rim for the glass.",

Botanicals like cardamom, caraway and dill pair beautifully with carrot, honey and hot sauce. Still, vodka makes a perfectly reputable Bunny Mary as well.",
			"It might seem counterintuitive to add honey syrup to a savory drink like one with carrot juice and caper brine. However, tomato juice is often sweetened, and the carrot juice used will likely need a little sweetener to punch it up. Meanwhile, the caper brine gives it some extra acidity (as does lemon juice), as well as a pungent saltiness. Crystal hot sauce, a vinegar-based hot sauce from Louisiana, has a moderate heat level, and with only a teaspoon added it won\u2019t bring too much fieriness to the party. If you\u2019re the type who loves a seriously spicy Bloody Mary, you can always up the amount added, or omit it entirely if making the drink for someone with low or no tolerance for heat.",

Fernet-Branca is a traditional Italian digestif\u00a0made from a secret mix of herbs including myrrh, saffron, chamomile and gentian. Its pronounced bitterness makes it a divisive spirit. Many people, especially those in the bar and restaurant industry, choose to drink it straight, but Fernet-Branca also appears in classic cocktails like the Hanky Panky. When used properly, its bitterness lends a subtle accent to drinks rather than overpowering them. In the Toronto, that bitterness is significantly softened by whiskey and sugar.",

The former camp notes that Fernet-Branca replaces sweet vermouth, while the latter camp says the fernet merely modifies the classic Old Fashioned formula of whiskey, sugar and bitters.

			"Many classic cocktails are tied to a particular place. The Manhattan was created at New York City\u2019s Manhattan Club, for example, and the Singapore Sling hails from the Raffles hotel in Singapore. While those international cities are two of the world\u2019s best-known drinks destinations, there\u2019s another cocktail that\u2019s equally linked to its birthplace: the Wisconsin Old Fashioned.",
			"Also known as the Brandy Old Fashioned, this variation on the traditional whiskey-based Old Fashioned is practically Wisconsin\u2019s official drink, and it\u2019s what will bw placed before you in bars all over the Badger State. The cocktail, in addition to featuring brandy, is differentiated by calling for muddled fruit and a dash of lemon-lime soda or sparking water. Serve a classic Old Fashioned with whiskey and an orange twist to a Wisconsinite, and you\u2019re likely to get the drink sent back.",
			"The cocktail\u2019s exact origin is unclear, but there are a few historical points that shed light on its provenance. During the time that the Old Fashioned was gracing American bar tops, the Midwest was turned onto Korbel brandy, which appeared at the World\u2019s Fair\u00a0in Chicago in 1893. Wisconsinites attending the fair\u2014many were German immigrants with a taste for brandy\u2014took note of the new spirit and made it a regular staple in their drinking diets. Given the Old Fashioned\u2019s ability to work with a variety of spirits, it\u2019s likely that, in Wisconsin, brandy usurped whiskey\u2019s place in the cocktail.",
			"Once Prohibition rolled around, quality spirits were difficult to source. Not deterred, thirsty drinkers continued to imbibe, but often utilized fruit, sugar, syrups and mixers to mask the flavor of subpar booze. In the case of the Wisconsin Old Fashioned, locals relied on fruit like oranges and cherries to flavor the cocktail, and they topped the drink with sparkling water or sodas like Sprite. The practice stuck around and, today, is still the preferred method.",
			"Old Fashioned purists might scoff at the muddled fruit and bubbly topper, but the Wisconsin Old Fashioned is as traditional as cocktails can be\u2014even if the cocktail is rarely found outside the state."

			"The elaborate cocktail combines gin, Grand Marnier, cherry liqueur, herbal liqueur (often B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine), pineapple, lime, bitters and club soda. The earliest published version of the recipe appeared in \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book,\u201d a 1930 classic written by Harry Craddock. Subsequent recipes followed, and by 1948, David A. Embury states in his book \u201cThe Fine Art of Mixing Drinks\u201d that no two published recipes for the Singapore Sling are the same.",
			"When constructed with precise measurements, the Singapore Sling is tart, refreshing and delicious. But by the 1980s, the drink had been relegated to a sugary mixture of gin, bottled sweet-and-sour and grenadine. Some bars served a bright-red mixture from machines, while others quickly shook up the concoction for tourists. Even the famous Long Bar serves two versions: one derived from a premixed batch that tastes like fruit punch, and another that uses fresh juices and is shaken by hand. Cocktails are subjective, but the latter receives a nod from cocktail aficionados.",
			"At its best, the Singapore Sling is nuanced, complex and ingredient-heavy. It\u2019s also ripe for experimentation. As such, most incarnations of the \u201cclassic\u201d cocktail are based on general notes and nostalgia. And many more modern versions result in an overly sweet drink that relies more on grenadine and pineapple juice than herbal liqueurs and fresh citrus. This recipe is as true to the classic as one can get; it\u2019s fruit-forward, herbaceous and strong. Give it a whirl, and then feel free to create your own version."

			"Not just anyone could do that, since The Garrick was (and still is) one of the city\u2019s most exclusive clubs. Its members are a peculiar assortment of actors and such, and their patrons: the poor but amusing and the rich and aristocratic. Fortunately, Hook was the former.",
			"Now, according to a witness there that afternoon, Hook was \u201cin that equivocal state of thirstiness which it requires something more than common to quench.\u201d Also fortunately for Hook, The Garrick\u2019s manager happened to be in the barroom at the time. Stephen Price was a New Yorker, a bit on the coarse side to be sure, but possessed with a little secret for making a truly quenching summer drink. (As any resident of the five boroughs knows, August in that city without the aid of such things is unendurable.)",
			"So Price set to ordering the Garrick\u2019s barman to do this and that, and next thing Hook knew there was a jug in front of him. Gin punch. We can\u2019t say exactly what his reaction was, but I suspect he was unimpressed. Englishmen had been drinking gin punch for a century\u2014poor ones at first, then merchants and finally dukes and admirals. They knew the concoction as a simple mix of alcohol, sugar, lemon, water and a touch of spice. Nothing to it.",

The invention of this refreshing highball is refreshingly clear: It was named after Joe Rickey, a Democratic lobbyist living in Washington, D.C., during the late 19th century.",

One day, he instructed a bartender at Shoomaker\u2019s bar to add some lime to his preferred highball, and the Bourbon Rickey was born. The tart, dry drink is surprisingly balanced considering its lack of sugar and is invigorating on a warm day.",
			"The Rickey took off, and soon, people were customizing the drink to their liking, with the Gin Rickey eventually becoming the most popular of them all. This simple twist subs gin for bourbon, taking advantage of the botanical spirit\u2019s natural ability to pair with fresh lime (consider the Gimlet) and sparkling water (think of the Tom Collins). Sugar is present in both the aforementioned cocktails, but the Rickey stands on its own, relying on the gin and lime for flavor and the water for dilution and balance.",
			"When making a Rickey, feel free to choose your preferred style of gin. A London dry is always a fine choice, while more citrusy and floral gins will add their own nuance to the cocktail. Fresh lime is a must, and a good sparkling water\u2014ideally from a bottle rather than a soda gun\u2014keeps the drink fizzy and thirst-quenching.",

That\u2019s why the Shirley Temple is a fixture at bars, whether it\u2019s on the official mocktail menu or simply made \u00e0 la minute for a guest. Of course, like all drinks, the quality can vary. Make your Shirley Temple with cheap bottled grenadine, sweet-and-sour and neon-red maraschino cherries, and you\u2019re bound to create a sickly sweet concoction that belongs squarely on the kid\u2019s menu. But use homemade grenadine (an easy mixture of pomegranate juice and water), fresh citrus, and garnish it with high-quality cherries, and you\u2019ll have a well-made example fit for discerning drinkers.",
			"Over the years, bartenders have found ways to tweak the Shirley Temple recipe. Some replace the ginger ale with ginger syrup and club soda, while others skip the ginger entirely and opt for lemon-lime soda or lemonade. You can also make this mocktail a cocktail, often dubbed the Dirty Shirley, by dosing it with vodka or another spirit of your choice.",
			"Regardless of which route you choose to go, the drink has staying power. It\u2019s the familiarity and ease of order that are the keys to the Shirley Temple\u2019s longevity. Ms. Temple herself, however, was not a fan of the drink, finding it too sweet. But perhaps even she would have enjoyed the popular elixir if she\u2019d tried this recipe, which features DIY grenadine, fresh lime juice and good cherries."

			"The Ward Eight, a turn-of-the-20th century concoction, is one of Boston\u2019s major contributions to craft cocktails. The cocktail was reportedly created in 1898 in Boston to celebrate the election of one Martin M. Lomasney to the state legislature. Lomasney was a politician who wielded considerable power in Boston for 40 years, serving as a state senator and representative as well as a political \u201cboss\u201d in the city\u2019s eighth ward.",
			"The drink, by all accounts, was created at the Locke-Ober Caf\u00e9 in Boston\u2019s eighth ward. Already nearly 20 years old when the drink was created there, the venerable French restaurant and bar survived until 2012, when it finally closed. As with any drink that old that wasn\u2019t written down at the time, there are different approaches to crafting it, but the most popular is a mix of rye whiskey, lemon and orange juices and grenadine, which is what author and cocktail historian David Wondrich specifies in his rendition here.",
			"Some stories describe the creation of the Ward Eight as happening before Lomasney officially won his election, so sure was the bar staff that he would do so. Many stories abound about the questionable nature as to his victory, including tales of him handing out pre-filled ballots to voters entering the polls. Regardless of would-be shifty dealings, the man was a popular politician.",
			"Essentially a riff on a rye Whiskey Sour, the Ward Eight sees some of the lemon juice substituted with orange, and simple syrup is replaced by grenadine. For decades, Rose\u2019s grenadine dominated the market, with most people associating the pomegranate-flavored bar syrup with a cloying concoction of corn syrup and artificial flavors and colors. Today, as in much of the bar world, there are options, including a number of grenadine brands made with real fruit juice. However, for those who can\u2019t find a favorite bottle on the shelves, or those who are feeling DIY-y, you can make your own homemade grenadine either with freshly juiced pomegranates or store-bought juice.",
			"The Ward Eight calls for a mere two teaspoons of the sweet-tart pomegranate syrup. Adding vodka to the grenadine keeps it shelf-stable for much longer, but for those who want to use it quickly, there\u2019s always the Jack Rose, the Tequila Sunrise and the Shirley Temple. Just be sure not to use a vodka-infused version if making a Shirley Temple or one of its non-alcoholic variations."

That\u2019s the case with the Burgundy & Gold from bartender Kevin Diedrich, co-owner of Pacific Cocktail Haven in San Francisco. While his bar is there, his team remains in Washington, D.C., and though it lost its problematic name, the team still retains the colors the drink is named for: burgundy and gold. \u201cBeing a Washington [football] fan in San Francisco is tough, as I imagine it is for any foreign fan in a city that\u2019s not their own,\u201d says Diedrich.",

Rather than employing bourbon, Diedrich uses rye whiskey out of homage for the team\u2019s home. \u201cIt... was one of the first spirits to be made in D.C.,\u201d he says. Specifically, Diedrich uses one from Copper Fox Distillery, located in Sperryville, Virginia, about an hour and a half outside of D.C. If that bottle is not available in your area, you can substitute another American rye whiskey.",

The yellow flesh gives the cocktail its signature golden hue, as well as tart, floral body.",
			"For the burgundy portion of the Burgundy & Gold, Diedrich takes a page out of the New York Sour book and finishes the drink with a red wine float. And rather than a more familiar red wine, say one from Burgundy, he uses port. The fortified wine imparts a dark ruby hue and a gentle sweetness, which is aided by a touch of pomegranate molasses.",

Before 1968, applejack was synonymous with apple brandy. It was only when consumer preferences started moving towards lighter products like vodka and gin that applejack\u2019s distinct identity took shape. The Lairds worked with the government to establish a new federal standard for blended apple brandy, and as a result, applejack is now defined as a blend of at least 20% apple distillate with neutral grain spirit that must be aged at least two years in oak.",

But recently, it has found renewed life, as bartenders discover new uses for the liqueur\u2019s unique flavor and color. Given its almost singular profile, Midori has few substitutes. So when an occasion calls for a bright green drink or a customer demands a melon-flavored cocktail, Midori is ready to heed the call.",

		"description": [
			"Sangria is a type of punch that combines wine with fruit, sugar and sometimes liquor. The exact origins of the drink are unknown, as people around the globe have been doctoring their wine for centuries. Versions of Sangria likely date back to at least the Middle Ages, when wine was safer to drink than water. It remained prevalent throughout Europe, especially in Spain and Portugal, eventually becoming the version we know today.",
			"Despite its popularity across the Atlantic, Sangria was mostly unknown to American drinkers until the 1964 World\u2019s Fair in New York. Served in the fair\u2019s Spanish Pavilion, the easygoing cocktail proved popular among attendees, who liked its bold red color and fruity taste. Ever since, Sangria has been a fixture at backyard barbecues, holiday parties and other occasions that necessitate a pitcher of festiveness.",
			"The typical Sangria recipe calls for red wine, but you can also make the drink with white wine, ros\u00e9 and even sparkling wine. And, lest you worry about depleting your favorite fancy bottle to make it, Sangrias work best with budget-friendly wine. Anything too complex will go missing, while anything too tannic may yield intense astringency. So keep that big, bold, celebration wine squarely on the shelf for this exercise.",
			"The best part about Sangria might be its versatility. A Spanish Rioja wine like tempranillo is always a great choice, given its dry and subtle nature. But you can try other Spanish (or not-Spanish) wines, too, like syrah or pinot noir. That experimentation doesn\u2019t end with the wine\u2014you can also have some fun with the fortifying spirit and the fruit.",
			"This recipe leans traditional and calls for brandy alongside oranges, apples and lemons\u2014a classic combination. But reach for whatever feels right in the moment. Want to add orange liqueur and a handful of berries? Sure. Prefer pears over apples? No problem. Are peaches currently in season? Great, slice one and throw it in. Fresh fruits that complement rather than overpower your chosen wine can all shine in this fun cocktail. Because the possibilities are nearly endless, you\u2019ll be able to mix up a delicious recipe, no matter the occasion."

The Manhattan\u2019s mix of American whiskey and Italian vermouth, enlivened with a few dashes of aromatic bitters, is timeless and tasty\u2014the very definition of what a cocktail should be.",

We find that bourbon creates a beautiful, if mellower, drink. And while Angostura bitters are a must in any variation, a single dash of orange bitters helps brighten the cocktail\u2019s edges, bringing the whiskey and vermouth together seamlessly, while the brandied cherry garnish lends a touch of sweetness.",

Like many old-school winners, the cocktail has resulted in many twists. But one of those variations simply flips the typical 2:1 whiskey-to-vermouth ratio on its head, giving vermouth the spotlight.",
			"When you swap the ingredients in a Manhattan, \u201cthe other component shines through, and it unveils a more rich, aromatic and almost spicy component,\u201d says Jenelle Engleson, a beverage director and sommelier in Nashville. She skips vermouth entirely in her Full Monte cocktail, choosing instead to pair rye whiskey with Amaro Montenegro. This Italian liqueur dates back to 1885 and is made from a secret blend of 40 botanicals, which coalesce into a predominate flavor of orange peels, florals and spice.",

Given the rise of amari at bars around the world, and drinkers collectively acquiring a taste for digestifs, the Full Monte is a friendly option that will fall right into the comfort zone for many stirred-cocktail aficionados.",

That is a boozy drink and a lot of absinthe, which can be a challenging flavor for some drinkers. If you like absinthe and want to try the original, go for it. However, DeGroff\u2019s version has become the preferred recipe during the modern era. It dials down the absinthe, opting for a quick rinse of the glass rather than a full pour. And the recipe borrows from the classic Manhattan by increasing the ratio of whiskey to vermouth.",

			"The Manhattan, featuring American whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters, was invented in New York around 1880. It quickly became one of the most popular cocktails in the country, eventually making its way around the world. Over the decades, creative bartenders found countless ways to vary the classic, experimenting with different spirits and fortified wines to create new versions that paid homage to the original.",
			"The Distrito Federal, also known as the Tequila Manhattan, is one such drink. Named for Mexico City, the cocktail is an aged-tequila twist on the standard that features reposado tequila, sweet vermouth and orange bitters.",
			"Reposado tequilas are aged in oak barrels for at least two months and up to one year. They\u2019re often matured in used whiskey barrels, which lend whiskey-like notes of vanilla, caramel and baking spices to the spirit. So the Tequila Manhattan hews closely to the original cocktail in that regard. Stir the ingredients with ice, and add a lime twist garnish to complement the tequila. It\u2019s an easy cocktail to make at home the next time you want a Manhattan\u2014but not the same Manhattan you\u2019ve been drinking for years."

			"The Rob Roy cocktail is similar to the beloved Manhattan, except the Rob Roy calls for scotch instead of American whiskey. The swap from bourbon (or rye) to scotch may not seem significant, but the difference is notable. And delicious.",
			"While the Manhattan dates back to around 1880, it\u2019s believed that the Rob Roy first appeared more than a decade later, likely around 1894 at the Waldorf Astoria\u2019s original location on Fifth Avenue. According to Frank Caiafa, NYC bartender and author of \u201cThe Waldorf Astoria Bar Book,\u201d the drink was inspired by an operetta named \u201cRob Roy,\u201d which was performed at the nearby Herald Square Theatre. Created by the composer Reginald De Koven and lyricist\u00a0Harry B. Smith, the operetta was\u00a0loosely based on a Scottish folk hero who was a Robin Hood-like figure named\u00a0Rob Roy MacGregor.",
			"Like any good spirit-forward cocktail, the Rob Roy is an opportunity to highlight what\u2019s in the glass, not hide it. Any number of scotches can yield a great drink, so choose your favorite. But note that you want a bottle that will pair with the herbal, bittersweet vermouth. Blended scotch is the usual choice. Single malts can certainly work, but anything too heavily peated may overpower the vermouth and lead to an unbalanced drink.",
			"The ratio of components varies, with many older recipes calling for equal parts scotch and vermouth and many newer recipes opting for a two-to-one build. This recipe puts emphasis on the whisky, letting it rise to the front so none of its nuance is lost.",
			"Mix a Rob Roy with different scotches and vermouths, and find the recipe you like best. If you want to keep experimenting, you can try a Perfect Rob Roy, which calls for equal parts sweet and dry vermouth. Or add a dash of B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine liqueur to make it a Bobby Burns. No matter how often you stray, you\u2019re likely to keep coming back to the original.

Applejack is a type of apple brandy that dates back to the late 1600s.

They increased the cider\u2019s alcohol content by leaving barrels outside overnight to freeze. Known as \u201cjacking,\u201d this method allowed these clever colonists to separate the alcohol that didn\u2019t freeze from the ice remaining in the barrels, resulting in a high-proof spirit they dubbed \u201capplejack.\u201d",

Switch to cognac for a Sidecar or gin for a White Lady. Juice limes and add a healthy pour of tequila for the perfect Margarita, or shake it with vodka, cranberry and lime for a pink-hued Cosmopolitan\u2014being perhaps the single most successful cocktail of the modern era.",

Not every combo will be brilliant, but your drink won\u2019t suck, and every now and again, you get lucky.\u201d Their common element is orange liqueur as a modifying sweetening agent.",
			"So just what would the next iteration look like? At first, McMillian, who is also the founder of The Museum of the American Cocktail, half-jokingly said it should be made with amaro as the base. He then realized it made perfect sense in the current cocktail climate.",
			"\u201cThe embrace of the bitter is about 10 years old,\u201d says McMillian. \u201cThis element of flavor is now mainstream as opposed to experimental.\u201d He had initially been resistant to amaro drinks and was late to the party in adopting them. But when he read that renowned bartender Audrey Saunders and cocktail expert Robert Hess substituted Branca Menta for cr\u00e8me de menthe in the Grasshopper, it gave him permission to flout the rules.",
			"McMillian started his modern sour with Averna but found it just wasn\u2019t quite bitter enough. Adding a splash of Cynar, the Italian liqueur made with artichoke and 12 other herbs and plants, was the intense solution. Cointreau lends the signature orange flavor, and lime juice keeps it tart. He serves it in a Collins glass over ice with a splash of soda, garnished with half an orange wheel for color and flavor. The drink is called the Jeez Louise, that less blasphemous exclamation of exasperation.",

			"Cucumber, basil and Fresno peppers imbue the vodka with a rich vegetal and herbal note, while the basil-infused simple syrup provides the cocktail with bright colors and another rich vein of basil flavor. Together they combine to create one of the freshest, most vibrant cocktails around.",
			"Using a sous vide machine to make a cocktail may seem complicated, but the devices are actually quite easy to use\u2014and they take a lot of the guesswork out of cooking by dialing in the exact temperature you want. You\u2019ll feel like a chef mixing this drink. And the best part is that you\u2019re making large batches of infused vodka and basil syrup. So while it takes some prep work to make your ingredients, you\u2019ll have plenty of leftovers on hand to make another round of drinks\u2014or to experiment with other cocktails."

Really, it\u2019s best to play around with it, trying what works, what doesn\u2019t and what is surprisingly good with a bit of earthy shrub in it.",

While it might be a bit rich and milky for warmer days (for some reason, the idea of drinking Eggnog in the sun has little appeal), the fall is a perfect fit for it.

While gin is still the traditional choice\u2014and the spirit itself has earned its way back into drinker\u2019s heart\u2014a good Vodka Gimlet has its charms.",

Then keep it away from the bottle of Rose\u2019s collecting dust on your bar.

Admittedly, when mixed with the \u201csour mix\u201d often used in the Amaretto Sour, it can be an unpleasant drink. But as an ingredient, there is plenty of purpose for the almond-flavored liqueur, as a number of bartenders around the country have determined (including Jeffery Morgenthaler of Portland, Oregon, whose Amaretto Sour recipe is a revelation).",
			"One such bartender is Ryan Ward, who worked as the beverage director at Momofuku CCDC in Washington, D.C. \u201cAmaretto isn\u2019t just almond; it has notes of vanilla, citrus and some baking spice,\u201d he says. In his variation on the classic French 75, he swaps the simple syrup for Amaretto, whose marzipan qualities imbue the drink with a \u201clush toasty note,\u201d according to him.",
			"Ward also says that the marzipan profile of the spirit lends itself well to mixing with citrus and spice flavors. This leads to the use of Nikka Coffey gin in his take on the French 75, which has lots of citrus and green pepper botanicals from sansho peppers, a relative of the Szechuan peppercorn. The Japanese gin\u2019s name is a reference to the column still used in distillation and named for its creator, the Irish distiller Aeneas Coffey.",
			"The French 75 is a rare drink in that its base spirit may have changed over the years. While some early recipes do include gin, others suggest that it was cognac that was originally used. However, using that or another brandy along with Ward\u2019s inclusion of Amaretto may make the drink too sweet, especially without the bite of pepperiness and the citrus tang that Nikka Coffey Gin has.",
			"For the brut sparkling wine portion of the drink, Champagne is, of course, never a bad call. However if that is out of reach, there are plenty of other sparkling wines on the market that would make a good French 75; just be sure to go as dry as possible or risk an overly sweet drink."

Once you\u2019ve obtained the ingredients, combine them in a pot with hot water, infusing the flavors and dissolving the sugar, just like you do with simple syrup. Make a little extra, and you\u2019ll be able to serve multiple rounds of the Delhi Cooler.",

If that\u2019s not available, another bone broth can be substituted, but it\u2019s important to use beef, bison or something equivalent; using anything like chicken or turkey will throw off the flavor profile, and using a pork bone broth runs the risk of taking the drink to over-porked levels.

			"Bartender, activist and educator Ashtin Berry created the Apprentice while working as the beverage director at the Tokyo Record Bar. A riff on the Dark \u2019n Stormy, she created it as an homage to the izakaya cuisine at the New York City lounge where vinyl rules. She loves the way heat in food coaxes out white miso\u2019s butterscotch notes. \u201cThe Dark \u2019n Stormy has this perfect blend of baking spiced fruit and ginger spice,\u201d says Berry. \u201cI decided to use the white miso and sweet potato notes of the shochu along with the bitterness of the Cynar liqueur to create a more savory version.\u201d",
			"The Apprentice substitutes shochu for the rum with which a Dark \u2019n Stormy is normally made. The lightly sweet, lower proof liqueur is very similar to Korean soju, and is usually made from sweet potato, barley or rice. If it\u2019s not available in your area, it is acceptable to use soju instead, though it will subtly change the notes of the drink, especially if using a rice-based soju rather than one made from sweet potato.",
			"Miso might, on first glance, appear to make the drink salty or funky. But the minimal amount of miso that goes into the syrup only gives the drink increased depth and complexity. The recipe below makes two cups of the miso syrup, but that can easily be cut down if you\u2019re not looking to make too many of these drinks.",
			"The richness and umami notes of the miso are balanced by the bright acid of yuzu juice. This East Asian citrus fruit that resembles a miniature yellow grapefruit can be difficult to find in the American market, though large Asian markets sometimes carry them or bottles of fresh yuzu juice. Online markets such as Amazon often carry it as well, though prices can be high even for smaller bottles of the juice. If unavailable, the closest, easiest substitute for yuzu is equal parts lime and lemon juice.",
			"After topping with club soda, a generous float of Cynar finishes the drink. This bittersweet Italian liqueur (with emphasis on the bitter) is famously made from the juice of artichokes, but you shouldn\u2019t let that scare you\u2014the ingredient gives it subtle vegetal notes, but nothing overwhelmingly \u201cartichoke.\u201d It does, however, give the drink a darker flushed hue of a Dark \u2019n Stormy, as well as some of the spice elements that it would normally get from ginger beer."

He added Coca-Cola and a little lime juice to his Bacard\u00ed rum and toasted his Cuban comrades by exclaiming, \u201cPor Cuba Libre!\u201d (\u201cTo a free Cuba!\u201d). The drink, and the name, stuck.",

But technically, the drink does not call for a specific rum, which means you can choose whichever rum you prefer.",
			"A light, Spanish-style rum like Bacard\u00ed certainly works, and making your drink with this rum will approximate the typical version served in bars across the land. But you can also try a richer, fuller-flavored rum from Jamaica, Central or South America or elsewhere.",
			"Rum and Coke is a classic combination that blends the tropical, grassy notes of the rum with the effervescent, spicy flavor of the cola. A squeeze of lime adds a zingy jolt of citrus that complements both ingredients while taming some of the sweetness. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the Cuba Libre contains caffeine and sugar, making it a preferred party drink, whether you\u2019re celebrating your independence at a dive bar or a dance club."

The oak-accented spirit is more similar to whiskey\u2014it\u2019s often aged in used whiskey barrels\u2014and takes on the vanilla, caramel and spice notes from the barrel while providing the roasted agave notes that tequila drinkers love. The cocktail combines that aged tequila with bitters and agave nectar (rather than simple syrup or granulated sugar) and is familiar, satisfying and delicious.",

			"As cocktail makers and drinkers have become more sophisticated, salt has been finding a regular home behind the bar. The element brightens and awakens even the most dormant ingredients, balances acidity and imbues a drink with exciting new layers. The most common use for salt is to line the rim of a beverage\u2014most famously the Margarita\u2014but using salt directly in the drink has its benefits, too. And as the American palate continues to crave fresh, new flavor combinations, infused salts are stepping into the spotlight. One such example is grasshopper salt, as is used in the Loaded Pistol.",
			"Created by Erick Castro, the co-founder of San Diego\u2019s Polite Provisions, the Loaded Pistol uses a garnish of grasshopper salt to enhance the flavors of mezcal, sweet vermouth and Strega, but also to lend a unique aspect. \u201cThe beauty of infused salts is that they bring their own flavor, rather than a simple sensation such as salty, sweet or sour,\u201d says Castro. And while many in the United States may find grasshopper salt unfamiliar, it\u2019s a relatively commonplace product in Oaxaca; because of this, mezcal, also from the Mexican state, makes perfect sense to pair with it.",
			"You won\u2019t have to go raid your nearby garden with a net to make grasshopper salt\u2014dried grasshoppers can be found in speciality stores, Latin American markets, and, of course, via the internet. And while the recipe is easy enough to throw together, there\u2019s also the option to order pre-made grasshopper salt. However, making your own has the added benefit of trying the grasshoppers themselves. Consider serving a small bowl of them as an accompaniment to the drink.",
			"The Loaded Pistol also includes sweet vermouth and Liquore Strega, an Italian digestivo. The liqueur gets its signature yellow hue from saffron, though it contains around 70 other ingredients including mint and fennel. Highly botanical and unusually strong for a liqueur at 80-proof, it gives the Loaded Pistol a deep herbaceous complexity. This is aided by a dash of grapefruit bitters, which also brighten the lush tones of the cocktail."

			"Now that we\u2019ve long since moved past the days of punches generally being overly sweetened bowls of fruit juice with a trace of liquor, there\u2019s plenty of room for large format drinks with interesting and high-end ingredients. One exemplar is the Oaxacan Punch from Tad Carducci, an award-winning bartender and founder of Tippling Bros., a bar consultant group. In this smoky, herbaceous punch, Carducci uses equal parts mezcal and Averna, as well as grapefruit and lemon juices, agave nectar, and ginger beer.",
			"Despite its most famous characteristic being its \u201csmokiness,\u201d mezcal has incredible range as a spirit, from crisp, slate-tinged mezcals to funky, heavily smoky expressions, and even bright and fruity ones. And while the vast majority of mezcal comes from Oaxaca, there are a number of other states in Mexico where the ancestral liquor is produced. Still, Carducci suggests Sombra mezcal for the Oaxacan Punch, a joven mezcal\u2014that is, a young, un-aged expression\u2014from Oaxaca.",
			"To that he combines an equal part of Averna, a bittersweet Sicilian amaro and classic digestif. This gives the punch a deep richness and botanical quality, which is offset by the acidic brightness of grapefruit and lemon juice. Some agave nectar, which pairs well with the mezcal, adds sweetness.",
			"Much of the volume of the punch comes in the form of ginger beer, which also gives it carbonation. It\u2019s important to keep in mind the distinction between ginger beer and ginger ale, the latter of which is often sweeter with less gingery kick. Additionally, different ginger beers have different levels of sweetness and spice, so you may need to adjust your recipe accordingly.",
			"Part of the charm of punch is in its delivery: an ornate punch bowl with a large block of ice and slices of citrus floating merrily in the bubbly drink provides a beautiful centerpiece to any get-together. Don\u2019t stress if you lack a proper punch bowl or a way to make large ice blocks, though. If you need to use smaller ice in a pitcher or bowl, consider cutting back on the added cold water to avoid overly diluting the drink."

			"The Corpse Reviver No. 1\u2019s first recorded recipe was in \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book,\u201d originally published in 1930. The recipe book was a collection of the Savoy Hotel London\u2019s most popular drinks. In it, bartender and author Harry Cradock writes of the Corpse Reviver No. 1, \u201cTo be taken before 11 a.m., or whenever steam and energy are needed.\u201d Of course, alcohol is not a stimulant like caffeine, and it is generally ill-advised to be drinking before noon, especially in pursuit of \u201cenergy.\u201d",

			"Aloe isn\u2019t just for sunburns and house plants. Beyond its topical and decorative uses, aloe can also be consumed when prepared properly. And these days, you can find it adding a unique twist to cocktails.",
			"Straight aloe can be bitter and difficult to work with, says Chicago bartender Angela Lovell. But in liqueur form, it shows delicate and round flavors of melon, cucumber and citrus. To make the Annie Oakley cocktail, she uses Chareau. The all-natural California liqueur is distilled with farm-fresh ingredients, including aloe, cucumber, spearmint, lemon peel and muskmelon, and it\u2019s the easiest way to get aloe into your drinks.",
			"Lovell pairs the Chareau with dry sake and a hibiscus-thyme shrub, a non-alcoholic ingredient made from vinegar, sugar and fruit or herbs. The sake complements the aloe liqueur with refreshing fruit flavors while keeping the ABV manageable, and the shrub provides tart acidity, herbal notes and the drink\u2019s deep-red color.",
			"\u201cWhile we went for the full herbal, floral explosion with this cocktail, the liqueur shows really beautifully with simple and subtle combinations like a touch of gin or vodka and a dash of interesting bitters, like orange or grapefruit,\u201d says Lovell.

			"In this twist on the classic by Erin Cusick, a bartender at Clover Club in New York City, a bit of mezcal, chile liqueur and spicy bitters combine forces to give the Negroni a smoky and piquant finish. \u201cThe most common misconception around spicy cocktails is that they\u2019re just heat and no nuance or flavor\u2014but when you tap into spice with actual flavor by using the right ingredients, you can create a nice, savory drink with some serious heat,\u201d says Cusick.

Either way, check on the mixture after one hour, and then taste every hour after that until you deem it ready.

			"Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the Negroni is said to have been invented in Florence by the dauntless Italian Count Camillo Negroni in the early 20th century. While at Bar Casoni in Florence, he demanded that the bartender strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano, by replacing the usual soda water with gin. To further differentiate the drink, the bartender also employed an orange peel rather than the typical lemon peel.",
			"It\u2019s a widely accepted tale, and one that is documented in \u201cSulle Tracce del Conte: La Vera Storia del Cocktail Negroni,\u201d which was written by Lucca Picchi, the head bartender at Caffe Rivoire in Florence, Italy, and translates to \u201cIn the Footsteps of the Count: The True Story of the Negroni Cocktail.\u201d The count\u2019s fateful substitution resulted in one of the most popular stirred drinks in history, as the Negroni sits next to the Martini and Manhattan in the pantheon of classics. It also launched a thousand riffs, and today the Negroni can be found in myriad iterations at restaurants and cocktail bars around the world.",
			"Few cocktails have encouraged more frenzied experimentation than the beloved Negroni during the course of its 100-year history. Its one-to-one-to-one recipe of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth has become the platform on which generations of drink mixers have left their thumbprint. Sub bourbon for gin, and you\u2019ve got the Boulevardier, a great cocktail in its own right. Try rum or mezcal in the same equal parts configuration with Campari and sweet vermouth, and you get far different yet equally balanced and impressive drinks.",
			"There are more ways to tweak the Negroni than by simply swapping its base spirit. The type of vermouth used can have an impact on the outcome too. Pick one that is more bitter, herbal, floral or dry, and you\u2019ll notice the difference. But Campari? That almost always stays put. You can try experimenting with a different bitter liqueur, and some bartenders do. But Campari is the one ingredient that nearly all Negronis have in common.",
			"So, how do you mix the perfect classic version? Start by selecting the right base materials. The key to a great Negroni is finding a gin-vermouth pairing that complements, rather than overpowers, the bitter, bold flavors of Campari. Once you zero in on a winning trio, write it down, memorize it, and request it at your favorite bar. You\u2019ll gain the barkeep\u2019s respect, make the count proud and, most importantly, enjoy a good drink."

			"It\u2019s hard to think of a drink that was as iconic to the so-called Cocktail Renaissance\u2014that surge in the late 2000s when bartenders were developing new craft drinks and re-discovering old ones\u2014as the Negroni (though admittedly the Daiquiri is a serious contender, too). The drink became almost synonymous with the craft cocktail movement for its simplicity (three ingredients in equal parts), its iconic crimson hue and its compelling and bittersweet flavors. It grew so popular that Campari, the brand behind one of its key ingredients, even launched Negroni Week, a yearly international fundraiser that sees thousands of bars across the world featuring their own takes on the Negroni, with a portion of the profits going to charities.",
			"However, in Italy, it\u2019s just a drink that has been enjoyed for over a century, without a lot of fanfare. Order one in a bar anywhere in Milan and you\u2019ll receive a (often huge) glass of ice with all three ingredients quickly poured in, served, and garnished with an orange peel; no fuss, no theatrics and, almost always, no variations.",
			"One of the core premises to the drink is that it\u2019s served like it is in Milanese cafes: over a number of ice cubes. For many Negroni enthusiasts, that ice is the fourth ingredient and fundamental to the drink. Like a Mint Julep, the drink transforms as the ice slowly melts, expressing nuances and mellowing the drink\u2019s normally acerbic and bracing properties. However, some bartenders prefer to serve it up, as it is in the Neighborhood Negroni from the famous bartender and author Tony Abou-Ganim.",
			"It might seem like a subtle, insignificant change, however, it has a noticeable impact on the flavor of the drink. Serving it up in a chilled glass allows the bartender to control the exact amount of dilution the drink gets, regardless of how long the drinker lets it sit. And while there is a strong visual appeal for the more traditional, Italian style of serving it on the rocks, serving it up means you get to use a lovely vessel like a coupe or Nick & Nora glass.",
			"In his recipe, Abou-Ganim calls for Junipero gin, Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth and, of course, the obligatory Campari, each in equal part as befitting the Negroni\u2019s golden ratio. A relatively high alcohol gin at 98.6 proof, Junipero is made in San Francisco, one of the capitals of the Cocktail Renaissance. Bold and very juniper forward, it makes for a potent and assertive Negroni, even when diluted over ice and served up."

At first glance, the bourbon-spiked Paper Plane might not seem too similar. But it follows the same template and consists of equal parts bourbon, Amaro Nonino, Aperol and lemon juice. Both drinks strike a beautiful balance between bitter, sour and herbal notes.",

Guests enjoyed the cocktail, so Ross brought it with him when he went back to New York. He served it at Milk & Honey, and the cocktail\u2019s following proliferated from there.",

			"For decades, one of the hottest cocktails was the Rusty Nail. But after a good run, the simple combination of scotch and the scotch-based liqueur Drambuie, a word derived from Gaelic meaning \u201cthe drink that satisfies,\u201d has fallen off most bar menus and is rarely ordered by patrons.",
			"Just as mystifying as its disappearance was its appearance in the first place. The lineage of the potent after-dinner libation is contested, with many believing it was invented in 1937 for the British Industries Fair trade show. It does appear in the 1967 edition of \u201cOld Mister Boston Official Bartender\u2019s Guide,\u201d the cocktail book of record through the post-Prohibition 20th century. (A similar drink, dubbed the Little Club #1, is included in Ted Saucier\u2019s 1951 \u201cBottoms Up.\u201d)",
			"By the late 1960s, bars in New Orleans and New York were serving the concoction, and \u201cHave you tried a Rusty Nail?\u201d was a common refrain. The Rusty Nail is often credited to the clever bartenders at the 21 Club in Manhattan sometime in the early 1960s. It makes sense, being that the establishment created the famous B & B\u2014half B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine and half cognac\u2014as well. It\u2019s easy to imagine that the talented crew applied the same formula to another cordial and liquor, but I haven\u2019t been able to substantiate that claim.",
			"Lore has it that the Rat Pack was enamored with the drink, which may have been responsible for the wide appeal in those years. In the 1970s, I mixed many a Rusty Nail at the joints I worked at in New York. They were also a hit at P.J. Clarke\u2019s, a favorite late-night haunt of Frank Sinatra.",
			"As with lots of classics, the recipe varies widely. Ted Haigh, the author of \u201cVintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails,\u201d likes two parts scotch to one part Drambuie; \u201cOld Mister Boston\u201d calls for a one-to-one ratio; and many modern versions are far drier, with some suggesting four parts whisky to one part liqueur. You could also substitute bourbon for scotch and get a Rusty Spike. But the Rusty Nail is a classic for a reason, and the two-to-one ratio will always be a fine example of the drink."

But given Japan\u2019s impressive cocktail culture, it\u2019s no surprise that whiskey often finds its way into cocktails, both elaborate and simple, like the Highball Mizuwari.",

			"As with most Highballs, the quality of the ice used and the temperature of the glass, whiskey and water are essential for optimizing the cocktail. But this ritual is more involved than combining the two liquids. The Highball Mizuwari demands perfect technique and attention to detail in order to boost the flavors and the effervescence, rendering this simple drink so satisfying.",

That\u2019s 17 total stirs, for those who lost count. It\u2019s debatable whether stirring 16 or 18 times would make much difference, but the mizuwari ritual is fun, and it\u2019s a glimpse into the serious, meticulous nature of bartending in Japan. So, the next time you make a Highball, count your stirs and enjoy the results."

			"In recent years, Japanese whisky has become incredibly popular in the United States, with sales booming over the last decade as Japanese distillers struggle to match production with the demand. One of the most popular ways to enjoy the variety of whiskies from Japan is in a highball. In fact, the highball has become inexorably linked to Japanese whisky, so much so that a misconception has developed that a highball or neat are the only \u201cright\u201d ways to consume the stuff.",
			"Misconception or no, a highball is a splendid way to try Japanese whiskies, and there\u2019s no requirement that it has to be topped with club soda alone. In the Green Tea Highball, it\u2019s combined with Japan\u2019s most consumed beverage: green tea. The most common type of green tea in the country is sencha, produced by picking only the youngest tea leaves, which are then steamed, rolled and dried. In this highball, the tea adds a bit of body, tannin structure and sweetness to complement the whisky.",
			"One of the benefits of the Green Tea Highball is its versatility. While using something like the affordable and accessible Suntory Toki will make a delightful drink, there\u2019s an opportunity here to try your hand with whatever Japanese whisky you can find. Availability can range wildly for different brands and expressions, but if you can find a favorite and play with combinations using different green teas until something clicks, you may find your new favorite highball recipe.",
			"Another trendy aspect of highballs, especially those made with Japanese whisky, is the use of a long, slender ice spear. However, if you don\u2019t have the mold for it, feel free to use a number of larger ice cubes. The important thing is to avoid too much surface area in order to slow dilution.",
			"Finally, while citrus oils are a common finishing touch for a whisky highball, the Green Tea Highball gets its citrus element from the tea. So instead of a lemon or lime peel, it\u2019s garnished with a maple leaf candy, which provides a sweet treat that can be enjoyed alongside the drink, enhancing the sweetness of the tea and whisky."

It\u2019s probably the 20th century\u2019s most important tome of its kind, having preserved many of the era\u2019s most important drinks.",
			"Craddock, an American who fled the country when Prohibition hit in 1920, documented hundreds of drinks that he served (and, in some cases, invented) at American Bar in London\u2019s swank Savoy Hotel. More than a few of them\u2014the Pegu Club, for instance\u2014are still served today in cocktail bars.",

Toast her today by fixing her signature Hanky Panky, a fabulous mixture featuring equal parts gin and sweet vermouth. It starts off like a Martinez, but rather than maraschino liqueur and bitters, it receives a couple dashes of the bitter amaro Fernet-Branca for good measure.",
			"Coleman created the cocktail for Sir Charles Hawtrey, a celebrated actor who visited the bar. As the story goes, he asked for a drink with a punch. Coleman served him this fine number, leading him to exclaim \u201cBy Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!\u201d The name stuck.",

			"The classic Martini has a storied history, although one that is difficult to pin down with precision. The Dry Martini as we know it today likely took form around the turn of the 20th century, and ever since, it has been a popular vehicle for experimentation.",
			"The usual recipe of gin, dry vermouth and sometimes bitters leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Go heavy on the gin for a drier drink, and use more vermouth for a wetter drink. But even those wetter Martinis typically don\u2019t give the gin and vermouth equal footing. For that, you must look to the 50/50 Martini.",
			"This variation calls for equal portions of gin and dry vermouth, yielding a drink that is lower in alcohol and far less dry than most recipes. The drink\u2019s origin story is a fuzzy one, and it\u2019s likely that many people in many places at various points in time experimented with a 50/50 ratio of ingredients. But the drink\u2019s first appearance in a cocktail book belongs to Harry Craddock\u2019s famed 1930 tome, \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book.\u201d",
			"Like many old-school drinks, the 50/50 Martini all but disappeared from rotation until a band of pioneering bartenders brought it back to life in the late-1990s and early-2000s. Sasha Petraske served the cocktail at Milk & Honey, and Audrey Saunders put it on her menu at the influential Pegu Club\u2014both located in New York. Dubbed the \u201cFitty-Fitty,\u201d Pegu Club\u2019s version featured identical measures of gin and vermouth, plus one dash each of Fee Brother\u2019s orange bitters and Regan\u2019s orange bitters. It was there at Pegu Club that hoards of enthusiastic drinkers were first introduced to the 50/50 Martini\u2019s charms.",
			"When making the cocktail for yourself, you have three important decisions: which gin to use, which vermouth to use, and whether to add orange bitters. This ability to choose your own adventure allows you to personalize the drink to your tastes. A London dry gin and floral French vermouth leans traditional, while a modern, less juniper-heavy gin paired with an herbal, more bitter vermouth can take the flavor in new directions. Orange bitters are there to provide structure and a mild zesty note, should that sound appealing.",
			"With its lighter flavor profile and lower-alcohol sensibilities, the 50/50 might not be the Martini you\u2019re used to, but it\u2019s a Martini worth meeting."

			"Who mixed the world\u2019s first Martini? It\u2019s a good question, but you could stumble down a very deep, dark rabbit hole trying to find out. Was it a California prospector during the 1849 Gold Rush or the barman at a flossy New York City hotel 50 years later? Most likely, the Martini is a cocktail that came onto the scene in multiple places at once, as bartenders began to experiment with gin and dry vermouth. Regardless, no origin story will leave you feeling as blissful and content as you will feel after drinking a classic, well-made Dry Martini.",
			"One fact we do know: The drink\u2019s original form, according to early recipes, was sweet. Nineteenth-century cocktail books regularly called for Italian (sweet) vermouth. The Dry Martini took its current form around 1905, when the new order of the day was dry gin, dry vermouth and perhaps a dash of orange bitters for good measure.",
			"When making the drink for yourself, it\u2019s imperative that you start with good ingredients\u2014after all, there\u2019s no place to hide in such a straightforward cocktail. Begin with a London-style gin. From there, add a little dry vermouth. The ratio is negotiable, but common formulas typically fall in the range of four-to-eight parts gin to one part vermouth. A dash of orange bitters ties the room together.",
			"Despite the exacting demands of a certain fictional British spy, the Martini is meant to be stirred, not shaken. The cocktail should be clear, sans ice shards. But do stir it for a good 20 to 30 seconds to yield the proper dilution necessary to bring the ingredients into balance. Then, strain it into the glass named after the cocktail itself. Twist a lemon peel over the top, and there you have it: a Dry Martini. It\u2019s a drink worth getting to the bottom of. Maybe more than once.",
			"It\u2019s also a drink that\u2019s spurred countless variations. No, we\u2019re not talking about the ubiquitous \u2019Tinis of the 1980s and \u201990s. We mean the legitimate variations, like the Vodka Martini (self-explanatory), the Reverse Martini (swap your gin and vermouth ratios) and the Perfect Martini, which features an equal split of dry and sweet vermouth. Master the Dry Martini first, then try your hand at mixing its relatives."

But how can you add further depth, richness and boozy sophistication to the classic cocktail?",

			"Crisp, botanical, bracing, bold\u2014all of these are terms that can be used to described the Alaska. A close relative of the Martini, the Alaska was developed in the early 1900s, though the origin of its name remains a mystery. Originally, the recipe called for Old Tom Gin, a sweeter, barrel-aged gin historically used in the Martinez. By the Alaska\u2019s publication in \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book\u201d in 1930, however, the Old Tom was replaced with a London dry gin, and has remained so since. \u201cIt dances between spirit-driven and citrus-forward,\u201d says bartender Keli Rivers, formerly of San Francisco's Whitechapel, a temple of gin and gin cocktails. \u201cIt\u2019s good, moving from one side of the spectrum to the other.\u201d",
			"Like a Martini, the Alaska is a straightforward drink to construct, with only gin, yellow Chartreuse and a dash of bitters needed. However, each ingredient is a potent elixir on its own. Yellow Chartreuse is less commonly used in cocktails than its green brethren, and is sweeter and a bit less botanical, though still a deeply herbaceous spirit. Orange bitters add further complexity and botanical notes, as well as a bit of aromatic citrus that is amplified by the lemon zest garnish.",
			"This simplicity in execution, though, means that the gin choice for the drink is crucial. This is not a cocktail where a bottom shelf brand can slip by unnoticed. And while the \u201cbest\u201d gin for the drink is up to your personal taste preferences, the overt botanical nature of the yellow Chartreuse means a cleaner, more juniper-focused gin is a good pick."

			"There\u2019s plenty of debate around what makes the best Martini in terms of spirit-to-vermouth ratio; there\u2019s the old-school camp that prefers little to no vermouth, and on the complete opposite side of the field, those who prefer what\u2019s called a Reverse Martini, when the vermouth takes center stage and is bolstered by gin or vodka. At The Recess Room in Fountain Valley, California, bartender Dany Maldonado goes even further with an incredibly busy but dangerously quaffable riff on the Reverse Martini. The Summer Lips has nine ingredients in all but deftly walks a tightrope between sweet, dry and fruity.",
			"The base of the cocktail is Lillet Blanc. Essentially a modern take on a now-lost aperitif Kina Lillet, the vermouth is best known for its inclusion in the Vesper, James Bond\u2019s take on the Martini. Lillet Blanc is, by all accounts, sweeter and less bitter than its progenitor, lacking the quinine of the original aperitif, and it works well as the base of this drink. It gets fortified by Absolut Elyx vodka in Maldonado\u2019s recipe, and then the drink gets a bit more complicated.",
			"Dry cura\u00e7ao is a bittersweet orange liqueur, and should never be substituted with the cloyingly sweet orange cura\u00e7ao from the lower shelves of the liquor store. Dolin Dry is an excellent value for an all-purpose dry vermouth that can be readily used in a more traditional Martini if the mood strikes. Aquavit brings some extra botanical notes to the party, often those of fennel, cardamom and caraway. Be sure not to use an aged aquavit, as that could potentially ruin the drink\u2019s otherwise pristine clarity. Then chardonnay adds a bit of fruit and acid, and a bar spoon of Green Chartreuse\u2014plus a dash of orange bitters\u2014adds even more complexity and botanical depth.",

The man was onto something, but the cocktail predates Bond by nearly a century.",
			"The Americano was first served in the 1860s at Gaspare Campari\u2019s bar in Milan, Italy. The drink, which features Campari and sweet vermouth in equal parts topped with sparkling water, is an effortless take on the Milano-Torino, which contained Campari and sweet vermouth, sans water. It\u2019s believed that the name stems from its popularity among American tourists. And it\u2019s possible that the name wasn\u2019t affixed until the Prohibition era, when Americans absconded to Europe in droves, thirsty for good drinks.",

			"Since the cocktail has only three ingredients, it\u2019s important that each component be of the highest quality. Campari takes care of itself. The Italian aperitif is made from a proprietary infusion of herbs and fruit in alcohol, and it gives everything it touches a red-tinged punch of bitterness. You can choose your favorite sweet vermouth, but it\u2019s imperative that the vermouth is fresh: It should be stored in the fridge, and it will begin to change flavor within a month of opening the bottle. All that\u2019s left now is the water. A good club soda or sparkling mineral water with plenty of bite will cut through the bitter Campari and rich vermouth, rendering the drink refreshing and thirst-quenching.",

Then, of course, we have all the foods and drinks, which are too numerous to count without falling into a hungry trance wherein your eyes turn into spinning plates of pasta. The point is, Italy exports some of our favorite things, including the Negroni and Aperol Spritz. Now, let\u2019s add one more drink to the long list of good drinks: the Sgroppino, a delightful combo of prosecco, vodka and sorbet that hails from Venice and is part cocktail, part dessert.",

He mixed the Sgroppino tableside and says making it was just about as fun as drinking one. \u201cThe cliffs of Amalfi and village[s] on water cities of Italy are about as picturesque as summer can get,\u201d he says. \u201cThis regional Italian frozen cocktail derived from Venice is the ultimate summer refresher.\u201d It\u2019s hard to argue with that.",
			"Fortunately, you don\u2019t have to be in Italy or even NYC to taste the Sgroppino because it\u2019s simple to make at home. The drink only requires three easy-to-obtain ingredients, and you don\u2019t even need to enlist a shaker. Combine the ingredients in a bowl, give everything a good whip until the sorbet and liquids form into a smooth, icy mixture, and pour the contents into your glass. Serve after dinner on warm nights to channel Italy with each sip of the cold, delicious treat."

		"description": [
			"The history of punch is long and complex, with a number of different areas of the world having produced their own takes on what would eventually be called punch. According to cocktail historian and writer David Wondrich\u2014whose book \u201cPunch, The Delights (and Dangers) of the Flowing Bowl\u201d (which you can find on Amazon) investigates the history of the drink\u2014punch started out as a beverage enjoyed by British sailors. Originally, it was made with arrack, a rum from South Asia made with sugarcane or fermented coconut sugar. Sweetener, citrus juice, spices, and water were also added to the concoction.",
			"Eventually, the recipe evolved into a whole range of drinks, though the general format remained\u2014usually a dark spirit like rum, brandy, or whiskey is mixed with citrus or other fruit juices, some kind of sweetener, often a wine and sometimes tea. The Port Royal Punch, on the other hand, borrows from the modern idea of a \u201cfruit punch,\u201d\u00a0as it uses a considerable amount of juice. And rather than something like sparkling wine, its carbonation comes from that ubiquitous of citrus sodas: Sprite. A bit of grenadine makes it even sweeter, though using a homemade grenadine will keep it from being too cloying.",
			"Unlike a recipe from Wondrich\u2019s book on punch, the Port Royal would be more likely found at a college party or a club than it would be on the bar of a cocktail lounge. Spiced rum, pineapple and mango juice, Sprite, and grenadine are uncommon in modern craft cocktails. However, if you\u2019re hosting a party for friends who want something a little sweeter, something that hides its alcoholic content amongst fruit juices and sodas, and something that you\u2019re more in danger of contracting a sugar high over than getting too drunk from, then it\u2019s sure to be a party pleaser.",
			"One of the key aspects to punch is its presentation, and the most obvious bit is the punch bowl itself. These days, it\u2019s easy to find ornate examples both online and at vintage shops. While you can use a regular mixing bowl, besides its underwhelming appearance compared to something ornate, it\u2019s difficult to find one that fits the volume of the Port Royal Punch. The other alternative is a large pitcher, and again, it\u2019s an opportunity to get ornate.",
			"The other key ingredient for both presentation and flavor is ice. There\u2019s always bagged ice from convenience stores, but in order to take it to the next level visually, and to keep the punch from getting diluted soon after serving, try freezing a massive ice cube using a large storage container or a mixing bowl. That will ensure much slower melting, and give the punch bowl a nicer look."

Or do they lack the mental acuity to combine alcoholic and non-alcoholic ingredients in just proportion? That won\u2019t wash, either\u2014Boston has always been a smart town.",

Once Boston discovered this simple potion, sometime around the turn of the 1700s, it must have said to itself, \u201cwhat could be better than this?\u201d and quit monkeying about with bottles and whatnot. The American Revolution was planned over bowls of it at places like the Green Dragon Tavern and Chase & Speakman\u2019s Distillery.

			"Ti\u2019 Punch is the national cocktail of Martinique. Calling for three ingredients\u2014lime, sugar cane syrup and rhum agricole\u2014it\u2019s a flavorful, easygoing cocktail that\u2019s woven into the cultural fabric of the island nation.",
			"If a Ti\u2019 Punch is on the menu, you must begin with rhum agricole. This French term signifies rum made from fresh sugarcane juice, rather than the more common molasses, and it\u2019s often characterized by grassy, earthy aromas and flavors. This style is native to French Caribbean islands, including Martinique and Guadeloupe. Rhum agricole works great in Daiquiris and other classic rum drinks, but it shines especially bright in the Ti\u2019 Punch.",
			"\u201cTi\u2019 Punch is part of the daily life in the French Caribbean,\u201d says Ben Jones of Spiribam, a company that markets and distributes several Caribbean rums. \u201cIt\u2019s not much different than espresso in Italy. Most people like it strong as a pick-me-up throughout the day.\u201d He adds that each person has their own preferred method for preparing the drink, and it\u2019s customary to welcome visitors with a Ti\u2019 Punch upon arrival.",
			"Traditionally, the Ti\u2019 Punch is neither shaken nor stirred. Instead, it\u2019s built in the same rocks glass it\u2019s served in. Start by adding a lime wheel and its juice to the glass, then stir or swizzle with a teaspoon or so of sugar cane syrup until the two ingredients are combined. Finally, add the rhum agricole, typically the unaged blanc variety. Ice is optional. Room temperature cocktails can seem unusual to drinkers who are accustomed to cold beverages, but forgoing the ice is a common practice in the French Caribbean."

			"The Tom Collins is a classic for a reason: refreshing, botanical and easy to make, it\u2019s a consummate drink for home bartending, whether you\u2019re entertaining guests or relaxing alone. But for those who want to maintain the ease of crafting a simple highball while also adding some complexity to the final product, bartending veteran and educator Charlotte Voisey has a solution: infused spirits.",
			"It may seem a daunting prospect at first, more difficult than simply building a drink with some extra ingredients, but Voisey makes it surprisingly easy with two different forms of infusion: a slow-infused vodka, and a fast infused tequila.",
			"Her recipe for infused Stolichnaya vodka includes lemongrass and pears. She notes that lemongrass has a beautiful and delicate flavor that goes especially well in vodka cocktails. Chopped up coarsely with fresh pear and left to rest for a few days, it creates a bright, lightly sweet and aromatic product that only needs some soda water, lime and simple syrup to make for an impressive drink that\u2019s a breeze to throw together.",
			"Voisey\u2019s recipe for infused tequila is even faster and easier, but it does require some kitchen tools. Namely, it requires a soda syphon\u2014she uses an iSi soda syphon, to which she adds some silver tequila and a fresh bunch of lemon basil, then charges it with two CO2 canisters. The result is a lightly carbonated tequila dense with lemon basil flavors. After some chilled club soda to lengthen the drink, she serves it either over ice or in a Champagne stem for some added elegance.",
			"In addition to the ease of construction, Voisey also notes that infusing the spirits this way allows you to have flavors on hand year-round that you might not have otherwise. She finds her produce at the farmers markets when it is in season, then has it for the rest of the year in the form of an infused spirit."

			"Mexico\u2019s contribution to the cocktail canon is extensive. Just look at the Paloma, a drink that\u2019s consumed in droves across the border, despite it playing second fiddle to the Margarita in the United States.",
			"The Paloma is a refreshing, easy-to-make cooler that combines tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. Its origin story is nebulous, but most reports peg its creation to the 1950s. Blanco tequila is the traditional choice, but lightly aged reposado also makes a fine drink. In this case, it\u2019s best to keep the a\u00f1ejo capped, as the well-aged expression\u2019s oaky profile disrupts that clean, refreshing taste you want in a Paloma.",
			"In Mexico, Jarritos soda is a popular choice for adding the effervescent grapefruit note. This brand is relatively easy to find stateside, particularly in grocery stores that stock Mexican foods and ingredients. Squirt is another common pick in Mexico, while Ting and Fresca are also suitable options. However, as bartenders continue to embrace fresh juice in their cocktails, it has become increasingly common to use fresh grapefruit juice in place of the grapefruit soda. If you want to go that route, you can complement the juice with unflavored sparkling water to achieve the necessary bubbly effect. This combination yields a similar cocktail, so it\u2019s worth the experiment. But grapefruit soda is the more traditional choice when making Palomas.",
			"Some people may also choose to rim the glass with salt, while others add a pinch of salt straight into the glass. This step isn\u2019t necessary, but it does add a savory quality that melds beautifully with the earthy tequila and tart grapefruit. And it opens the possibility of using a spiced salt, like Taj\u00edn, for an extra seasoning kick.",
			"Because the Paloma is constructed right in the glass, you don\u2019t need any bar tools to make it. Just add your ingredients to a highball glass with ice, and you\u2019re ready to enjoy a refreshing cocktail. Don\u2019t wait for Cinco de Mayo\u2014that very north-of-the-border-only Mexican holiday\u2014to treat yourself. Mexico\u2019s national cocktail is a great choice any day of the year."

			"Planter\u2019s Punch is a simple mixture of rum, citrus, sugar and spice. This classic drink has been quenching thirsts since the late-1800s, but its origins are murky. Though hotels in Charleston and St. Louis are associated with the cocktail, it\u2019s more likely that it originated in Jamaica.",
			"Several accounts credit the Planter\u2019s Punch to Myers\u2019s Rum. The Jamaican rum brand sold a Planter\u2019s Punch Rum to be used specifically in the cocktail, and this product helped to popularize the recipe among drinkers. The cocktail was fashionable in the United States through the 1960s, until the Tiki craze began to subside. The cocktail lost its luster over the years, but it was revived during the Tiki renaissance of the 2000s and resurfaced in cocktail books, like Ted Haigh\u2019s influential 2009 tome, \u201cVintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails.\u201d",

There isn\u2019t one right way to make it, so feel free to give the drink your personal spin.",
			"This recipe sticks with three parts strong (the rum), while employing nearly equal measures of sugar and citrus for the sweet and sour components. It also receives a dose of spice and complexity from the Angostura bitters, with a dash of soda water for dilution and effervescence. Combine the ingredients with plenty of ice for a tall, refreshing cocktail that channels Jamaica\u2019s warm climate and sandy beaches."

			"The Lion\u2019s Tail first appeared in \u201cThe Caf\u00e9 Royal Cocktail Book,\u201d which was published in 1937. But it\u2019s likely the drink was born during Prohibition, when onerous laws couldn\u2019t keep thirsty denizens from partaking in illicit concoctions. The book was published in London, but many believe the cocktail was created by an American. Their reasoning: The drink\u2019s name refers to the saying \u201ctwisting the lion\u2019s tail,\u201d a phrase that describes provoking the British, whose royal coat of arms features a lion.",
			"Featuring bourbon, allspice dram (a liqueur made with rum, pimento berries and spices), fresh lime juice, simple syrup and aromatic bitters, the Lion\u2019s Tail is an unusual drink that nearly slides into Tiki territory. But for all its talent and charm, the cocktail was forgotten for decades, resurfacing in the late-aughts thanks to the timely confluence of literature and product availability.",
			"Allspice dram lost favor after the mid-century Tiki boom and then disappeared from circulation altogether in the 1980s. That changed when St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram arrived stateside in 2008. This Austrian-made liqueur hit the market one year before the updated release of Ted Haigh\u2019s\u00a0\u201cVintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails,\u201d an important tome that heralded the return of many obscure and buried drinks, including the Lion\u2019s Tail.",

It\u2019s easy to see why: The drink is rich, spicy and aromatic and appeals to fans of both the Daiquiri and the Whiskey Sour. It leans heavily on the allspice and Angostura bitters without overpowering the bourbon, the lime adds a hint of tartness, and the simple syrup lends balance. This is one Lion\u2019s Tail you\u2019ll want to twist time and time again."

The ristretto taps into the inherent Italian expertise in making espresso, and\u2014unlike many other coffee liqueurs on the market\u2014uses multiple different kinds of coffee beans in a complex, multi-stage process.

			"The Harvey Wallbanger is a modern classic cocktail that was reportedly born in the 1950s, when it was first prepared by California bartender Donato \u201cDuke\u201d Antone. It\u2019s basically a Screwdriver with the addition of Galliano, an Italian liqueur.",
			"The Harvey Wallbanger may have been invented in the \u201950s (although that origin is debated), but it didn\u2019t become a runaway sensation until the early 1970s. An import company\u2019s marketing director, George Bednar, created an ad campaign that helped the drink fly off shelves as customers began to order it by name.",
			"Galliano is made with vanilla and a medley of herbs and spices, including star anise, juniper, lavender and cinnamon. It clocks in at 42.3% alcohol-by-volume, so it\u2019s no slouch in the booze department, which means it doesn\u2019t get lost in drinks. Still, most people know Galliano more for its tall, slender, bright yellow bottle than its flavor. But with its distinct taste, even small amounts can transform a cocktail. That\u2019s evident in the Harvey Wallbanger, which is notably different from the Screwdriver despite the scant half ounce of Galliano used in the drink.",
			"The Harvey Wallbanger is a breeze to put together. You don\u2019t even need a shaker; just build it right in the glass. The vodka and orange juice go in first, and the Galliano is floated on top. Garnish with an orange slice and cherry, and you can channel the golden days of disco."

			"Bourbon and cola is classic. Bourbon and ginger ale: same deal. But bourbon and root beer does not receive the attention it deserves. The fizzy soda\u2019s distinctive bite, imparted by sassafras root, helps dampen bourbon\u2019s sweetness, while the soda\u2019s earthy notes bring out more nuanced aromas. There\u2019s a hint of anise as well, reminiscent of a Sazerac, and a strong vanilla flavor that gives it all a lovely creaminess.",
			"Considering root beer\u2019s history, it is a natural addition to spirits. The method of brewing root beer evolved out of the tradition of small beer\u2014low-ABV brews that offered a less perilous alternative to the contaminated water of Medieval Europe but wouldn\u2019t leave its imbibers sloshed. (Early root beers were at least 2% alcoholic.) A teetotaler produced the first commercial root beer, and then there was Prohibition, and thus root beer became, definitively, a soft drink.",
			"Around the country, bartenders are beginning to tap into root beer\u2019s unrealized potential. \u201cRoot beer is an amazing mixer!\u201d says Juyoung Kang, the lead bartender of\u00a0The Dorsey\u00a0at\u00a0The Venetian\u00a0hotel in Las Vegas. She praises the \u201cgreat baking spice notes\u201d that echo and enhance the flavors imparted by whiskey barrels. Kristin Lozano, a bartender and consultant in Northern California, says that root beer is the perfect match for whiskey, especially a high-proof bourbon. And Nashville bartender Jonathan Howard also finds root beer superior to more conventional whiskey accompaniments. \u201cDrinks with root beer have far more complexity and richness than just using a common mixer like ginger ale,\u201d he says, citing root beer\u2019s herbaceous quality, vanilla notes and unique viscosity.",
			"These bartenders all use craft root beer for their cocktails and emphasize the importance of choosing one that\u2019s as high-caliber as the whiskey in question.",
			"Still, root beer isn\u2019t as ubiquitous as it should be, so give this recipe a try if you can\u2019t find a root beer cocktail near you.

The Hipster works because it bridges a gap between two beloved cocktail styles, all the while skirting the technical criteria of both classic builds.",
			"Spritzes generally involve three classic ingredients: an aperitivo or amaro, sparkling wine and a splash of club soda.

Back in 2018, Hazel\u2019s then-spirits manager Nick Farrell transformed his go-to drink order\u2014an ice-filled pint glass with a shot of aperitivo and a canned beer poured on top\u2014into this bright and complex cocktail that\u2019s one ingredient short of being a Spritz, essentially swapping beer in place of sparkling wine, which pairs up with the rest of the ingredients (a citrusy soda) placing its other foot in Shandy territory.

But with just a tweak to one ingredient, and you have a similarly refreshing and pleasing afternoon tipple that evokes the flavors of the Pacific Northwest: the Ranye West.",
			"Beyond a play on the name of the famously controversial rapper, the Ranye West is named for the nickname given to one the Northwest\u2019s most popular cheap brews: Rainier Beer. Named for the majestic mountain in the Washington part of the Cascade Range, Rainier beers go by many names in the Pacific Northwest, including Vitamin R and Ranye, a playful faux-French pronunciation of the name, which is actually like Rain-Ear. Like the prosecco normally called for in an Aperol Spritz, Rainier is light, bubbly, crisp and golden. Of course it\u2019s also around $1 a can, unlike most prosecco.",
			"A staple of dive bars, often served with a shot of whiskey or tequila for industry workers after their shifts, Rainier has become a symbol of Pacific Northwest working class. But it\u2019s also found a place in Shandies and other beer-based drinks due to its popularity. The Ranye West, from Seattle bartender Jeff Steiner, is one such drink, with Rainier replacing the wine and club soda in the spritz. A generous splash of lemon juice adds back in some of the acidity that gets lost when not using wine, and a few dashes of Angostura bitters brings some depth and complexity to the drink.",
			"Of course, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to use another domestic canned lager of your choosing. It can\u2019t technically be a Ranye West, as it lacks the beer the gives it the name, but it can still be a delicious and affordable alternative to the standard Aperol Spritz.

			"The Screwdriver is a classic drink that has been designated an International Bartender Association official cocktail. The history of the Screwdriver is somewhat debatable, even though mention of it in literature goes back to 1949, when vodka was first gaining traction in the United States.",
			"Some claim that the drink was first popularized by American aviators. Another origin story claims that it was made popular by American oil workers in the Persian Gulf, who would secretly dose their OJ with vodka. Supposedly, they dubbed the drink the Screwdriver because they mixed it first with a screwdriver when a spoon was not available.",
			"Questionable origin stories aside, it\u2019s easy to imagine drinkers building this simple, two-ingredient beverage, so it\u2019s possible the drink appeared in multiple places around the same time. After all, the Mimosa (sparkling wine and orange juice) had already been in rotation for a couple of decades by then, and it\u2019s not a far stretch from sparkling wine to vodka.",
			"The beauty of the Screwdriver lies in the cocktail\u2019s simplicity and the drink\u2019s adoption as a morning eye-opener. Combining orange juice and vodka in a highball glass is about as easy as a cocktail gets and creates a base that\u2019s ripe for experimentation, as witnessed by later inventions like the Harvey Wallbanger and Fuzzy Navel.",

			"The Sex on the Beach cocktail is known as much for its provocative name as its fruity, refreshing taste. It\u2019s unclear exactly when or where the drink was invented, but popular liquor-soaked lore points to a Florida bartender who created the drink in 1987 as part of a liquor distribution company\u2019s promotion to sell peach schnapps. The only problem with that theory, however, is that the drink was already included in the 1982 \u201cAmerican Bartenders School Guide to Drinks.\u201d",
			"While no one can agree where the drink originated, many suggest the cocktail may have been invented when a bartender combined a Fuzzy Navel (peach schnapps and orange juice) with a Cape Codder (vodka and cranberry juice). Put those two drinks together, and all the constituent parts of the Sex on the Beach are accounted for. Some recipes also call for a small measure of cr\u00e8me de cassis, but that is usually considered optional.",

Some people prefer to sub pineapple juice for the OJ, but orange will keep the cocktail classic. Any solid vodka will do, as it provides a mostly neutral base that lets the peach liqueur and fruit juices take center stage.

But the drink wasn\u2019t created until 1984, when Dick Bradsell (whose resume also includes the Espresso Martini) mixed this modern-classic at Fred\u2019s Club in London\u2019s Soho neighborhood. It\u2019s one of that decade\u2019s best success stories, standing apart from the era\u2019s provocatively named drinks that eschewed fresh ingredients in favor of bottled, neon-hued mixers.",
			"The Bramble was named for the bush that blackberries grow on and was inspired by the fresh berries that Bradsell used to pick as a child on the Isle of Wight. After receiving some creme de mure (a blackberry liqueur) for the bar, he began experimenting and came on a combination of gin, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup and creme de mure that was part Gin Sour, part Singapore Sling. He shook up the ingredients and strained them over crushed ice to tame the sweetness.",
			"There\u2019s no reason to tweak Bradsell\u2019s Bramble: It\u2019s great precisely as he made it back in 1984. But that hasn\u2019t stopped inventive bartenders from playing with the recipe. The easiest way to tweak the original is to swap in a different base spirit for the gin, like a dry pisco or grassy rhum agricole, or to drizzle another product on top, like Chambord raspberry liqueur. You can also shake a couple berries with the liquid ingredients to lend more flavor and color to the cocktail. All of these variations make a fine drink, but perhaps none provide the simple refreshment that Bradsell achieved behind the bar at Fred\u2019s Club.",

Serve this with breakfast, brunch or by the pool\u2014and consider your day saved."

The Mimosa solves that issue. The beverage joins another eye-opening morning stalwart, the Bloody Mary, as a supreme brunch cocktail that is universally acceptable to enjoy before the clock strikes noon.",
			"Composed of sparkling wine and orange juice, the Mimosa was created around 1925 and named for a yellow-flowered plant. Its origin is often pegged to Frank Meier, a bartender at the Ritz hotel in Paris during that time. Meier eventually included the recipe in his 1936 book, \u201cThe Artistry of Mixing Drinks,\u201d which is believed to be the Mimosa\u2019s first appearance in print.",
			"It\u2019s easy to see why the drink became a sensation. It\u2019s refreshing and delicious, and even the most novice drinks-makers can remember the two-part recipe. The Mimosa is also a lighter serve than the high-octane Screwdriver, which skips sparkling wine in favor of vodka, so it\u2019s a natural choice for morning consumption.",
			"With only two ingredients, you want to choose high-quality wine and juice\u2014so, the opposite of what you will find at the bottomless pitcher places. Start with a good, dry Champagne or other sparkling wine like prosecco or cava. And, like all drinks demanding juice, fresh is always best, so squeeze a couple oranges for the rich citrusy flavor and added benefit of vitamin C.",
			"Once your ingredients are handled, the simple Mimosa doesn\u2019t offer many opportunities to go off the rails. But be careful not to get too heavy-handed with the OJ. Rather than lengthening the cocktail with a hearty juice pour, be judicious with the juice. You want it to complement the sparkling wine instead of burying it.",

Unlike many sparkling wine cocktails, the Figurati doesn\u2019t use Champagne, prosecco or any other white, or even ros\u00e9, sparkling wine. Instead, Elliot uses lambrusco, and the famed Italian sparkler from Lombardy proves to be just the ticket for the base.",
			"Many drinkers only know lambrusco as Riunite, an inexpensive and widely produced brand that was popular in the 1970s. However, it\u2019s a broad style of wine that has plenty of more compelling examples, many of which work well in cocktails like the Figurati. \u201cWhile being light and effervescent, lambrusco is still full of depth and character,\u201d says Elliott, who crafted the Figurati when he was the lead bartender at Il Solito in Portland, Oregon. \u201cIt also provides just enough sweetness to satisfy most palates without being overly sweet; it\u2019s a great variant to the traditional sparkling white wine.\u201d",
			"To bolster the wine, Elliot adds Cappelletti aperitivo. This red-orange Italian liqueur is similar in ways to Campari, though it has a wine base, a lower ABV and is colored with natural carmine. You can even use it to replace Campari in your favorite Americano or Negroni recipe, which will lead to a slightly drier and lighter flavor.",
			"To give it even more red color, as well as a punch of botanicals, Elliot mixes in two dashes of Peychaud\u2019s bitters. Most famously used in the Sazerac, these historic New Orleans bitter have elements of gentian, anise and citrus along with a crimson hue.",
			"The Figurati is best served as a pre-dinner aperitif, especially when paired with some charcuterie or cheese. Or, try replacing your usual Aperol Spritz with the Figurati for your next patio happy hour. You might even find a renewed love of lambrusco through it."

But there\u2019s a reason for it, as the treat is a truly enticing indulgence. Throw in a glass of Champagne, and you have a perfectly lovely evening (or afternoon, or morning. No one will judge you). The Little Kiss, from Talmadge Lowe, beverage director at the Hospitality Collective, combines all of these elements into a single glass, with strawberry shrub and white cr\u00e8me de cacao topped with Champagne.",
			"Shrubs are a family of drinking vinegars, often used in cocktails or mixed with sodas for zero-proof drinks. The strawberry shrub used in the Little Kiss brings some tartness to the drink as well as fruitiness, which helps to balance the sweetness of the white cr\u00e8me de cacao. If you find you have a lot left over, it can also be used in other drinks, including the Jack & Dabs, a bright and zesty drink with gin and sherry over crushed ice. Fresh strawberries are the preferred ingredient for making the shrub, but thawed frozen strawberries will give plenty of juice and sweetness. Furthermore, they\u2019re far more accessible during the winter than ripe, fresh strawberries.",
			"When it comes to cr\u00e8me de cacao, it\u2019s important to use a white version, rather than a dark one. The white chocolate notes pair better with the strawberry shrub and sparkling wine, and the color keeps the drink from being muddy and cloudy.",
			"For the sparkling wine element, Champagne is always a good choice, as its dryness and brioche notes adds to the richness and complexity of the drink. However, if you don\u2019t want to drop the cash on a bottle of Champagne, another sparkling wine like a Cr\u00e9mant d\u2019Alsace, prosecco, or cava can stand in. Just be sure to use a wine that has little-to-no residual sugar, as the drink can be too sweet and cloying otherwise. A sparkling ros\u00e9, Champagne or otherwise, is a solid choice with the Little Kiss, amplifying the fruitiness of the strawberry and the brightness of the pink flush without raising the sweetness."

But rather than reaching for an expensive bottle of Champagne, try something a little different: Cr\u00e9mant d\u2019Alsace ros\u00e9, as bartender Katie Stipe does with the Rose-Colored Glass.",
			"Cr\u00e9mant d\u2019Alsace ros\u00e9 is a dry, pink sparkling wine from the French region of Alsace, a northeastern region bordering Germany. Its proximity to the country means the French region produces a good amount of German grape varietals like riesling and gewurztraminer. Cr\u00e9mant is a term describing wines made under the same rules of production as Champagne, known as m\u00e9thode-traditionelle, but in different regions. A key element of this is allowing the secondary fermentation to happen in the bottle, which gives the wine its telltale bubbles and yeasty notes, often described as brioche or biscuit-like.",
			"Like every region in France, Alsace has strict laws for what varietals it can use. While most white sparkling wines from the region use pinot blanc, Cr\u00e9mant d\u2019Alsace ros\u00e9 is strictly limited to being made with 100% pinot noir. You can also find Champagne ros\u00e9 made with 100% pinot noir, though this is rare\u2014it\u2019s much more likely to be a blend that includes chardonnay and pinot meunier in addition to pinot noir.",

This means the wine is more suitable for cocktail purposes, as with the Rose-Colored Glass.",
			"The Rose-Colored Glass has a similar base as the classic Champagne cocktail, which calls for a plopping a sugar cube into a Champagne flute, dabbing it with bitters and pouring Champagne, or another sparkling wine, over it.

A coupe steps in for the traditional flute, and to complete the look, it\u2019s finished with a rose petal garnish.",

Unlike the more familiar Mimosa you would have with brunch, this one doesn\u2019t have any orange juice, instead substituting cranberry juice. Ginger beer adds some spice, some sweetness and more carbonation, and the choice of which brand you go with is entirely up to your taste preferences; some are spicier with lots of raw ginger, while others are closer to ginger ale as far as sweetness and spice. If you\u2019re really ambitious, you can even make your own.",

This makes it a perfect drink to start a meal, before people have had time to eat anything. It also means it\u2019s a nice nightcap to indulge in while minimizing the risk of a rough next morning.

The aromatic compounds in absinthe are more soluble in alcohol than in water, so when the absinthe is diluted, those compounds drop out of solution and crowd together\u2014what we see as cloudiness. This process is evident in the classic Absinthe Drip, which combines absinthe with cold water and sugar.",

			"For years, American drinkers were tantalized by tales of the supposed hallucinogenic effects of the banned spirit absinthe. But while the alcohol packs a wallop (the proof ranges from 110 to 145), it\u2019s not actually mind altering, and since 2007 the so-called \u201cgreen fairy\u201d can once again be purchased legally in America.",
			"Drinkers now have a large selection of both foreign and domestic absinthes to choose from, including the historic Pernod Absinthe ($77) with fennel and hyssop on the nose and mint and anise on the palate; the California-made St. George Absinthe Verte ($60) with aromas of mint, green pepper and fennel and a bittersweet bite; and the artisanal Vieux Pontarlier Absinthe ($70) with hyssop, anise and dark chocolate on the nose and a savory finish.",
			"The production of absinthe is much like that of gin. A high-proof neutral spirit is infused with a blend of botanicals, including wormwood, and redistilled in a copper pot still. Traditionally, the liquor is infused a second time before bottling to intensify the flavor and create the signature green color. Many producers skip this final step and use dyes instead.",
			"There are basically two ways to drink absinthe. The traditional preparation is to slowly drip water over a sugar cube and into the spirit, which becomes cloudy. (An excellent selection of traditional absinthe glassware, spoons and fountains is available at Maison Absinthe.) You can also use small quantities of absinthe\u2014a few dashes, a rinse or one quarter of an ounce\u2014to add a floral, bittersweet quality to just about any cocktail.",
			"With absinthe not only legal but now quite easy to find at liquor stores and bars, you can enjoy a real Sazerac or a Corpse Reviver #2. Then try my Green Deacon recipe, with gin, sloe gin, grapefruit juice and an absinthe rinse. I\u2019ll take good drinks over hallucinations any day.",

It was at this institution that Beach created some of his most iconic cocktails, including the Zombie in 1934, which brings us to the contemporary riff at hand: Martin Cate\u2019s Undead Gentleman.",
			"A lot of things transpired in the cocktail world between the 1930s and now, of course, and the classics made way for countless offshoots along the way (though some origin stories are certainly muddier than others). What we do know, though, is that the Undead Gentleman and the Zombie are inextricably intertwined, along with Beach\u2019s later recipe for a drink he dubbed the Test Pilot and its 1958 riff, the Jet Pilot, by Steve Crane at his own Hollywood joint, the Luau. Beach\u2019s blended Test Pilot, which was named for the golden age of aviation that carried into World War II, called for fresh lime juice, Falernum (a lime-tinged spiced almond liqueur, in simple terms), dark Jamaican rum, light Puerto Rican rum, Cointreau, Angostura bitters and Pernod while Crane\u2019s interpretation brings grapefruit, cinnamon syrup and overproof rum into the mix. Despite having come before both of these cocktails, the Zombie\u2019s spirit base is essentially a cross between both the Test Pilot and the Jet Pilot, though this recipe includes Donn\u2019s Mix in addition to the Falernum as well as a teaspoon of grenadine.",

The newly-rediscovered Corpse Reviver No. 2, with its heady mix of gin, lemon juice, Lillet Blanc, Cointreau and absinthe became a hit, popping up on bar menus all over the world.

Jennifer Peters, the founder of Denver\u2019s gluten-free caf\u00e9 Just BE Kitchen, developed her own take on the Mimosa, swapping its usual orange juice for kombucha, the naturally fermented, lightly effervescent tea drink. \u201cPeople go crazy over the Kombucha Mimosas,\u201d says Peters. \u201cThe best part is you\u2019re getting probiotics in your bubbles.\u201d",

Citrus kombuchas are an obvious fit in a Kombucha Mimosa, mimicking the usual juice, but other flavors can also work well. Try using a gingery or cinnamon kombucha during the winter months for a cool weather drink, or mint-infused kombucha for summertime drinking. Kombucha made with black or green tea will have more caffeine, while ones made with herbal teas deliver a more mellow experience.",
			"Along with a variety of flavors and styles there are also numerous companies producing kombucha, from small, local brands making individually bottled versions to bigger companies getting in on the scene with large-scale production. You could even try your hand at making your own kombucha; along with baking sourdough bread, it\u2019s become a popular hobby in recent years. Once you\u2019ve got a healthy scoby going (that\u2019s the name for the culture that creates kombucha), you can make repeated batches of it, and add whatever kind of flavoring best suits your tastes.",
			"While the kombucha is one important aspect of the drink, the other ingredient to contend with is the choice of sparkling wine. Champagne is always a good bet, but for breakfast drinks like the Kombucha Mimosa, sometimes something bright and lighter, like cava or prosecco, is the way to go. Whatever the case, be sure to balance the levels of sweetness in the wine and kombucha or a risk an overly sweet, or overly tart, drink."

Often, it means fruits, spices and syrups, but other times it means more vegetal ingredients.

This playful take on a Margarita comes from Naren Young\u2014an accomplished bartender and drinks writer\u2014and its color lives up to the name.",

For the orange liqueur element, Young opts for Combier; it\u2019s fantastic for a Margarita but can be replaced with something like Cointreau or Grand Marnier if need be, both of which fill in nicely. However, rather than simple syrup or another sweetener, the Green Margarita calls for dry vermouth, which brightens the drink while adding salinity and botanicals.",
			"The most notable feature of this Margarita variation, however, is the sugar snap pea puree. Alongside the fresh peas that are blended into it, the puree also gets verjus. Verjus is unsweetened, unfermented juice that was pressed off from unripe grapes, often those used in winemaking.

			"Most people can recite the reported health benefits of the mighty avocado\u2014loaded with nutrients, antioxidants and plenty of that supposedly beneficial kind of fat. An essential part of many Mexican and other Latin American dishes, and a beloved topping for toast at hip caf\u00e9s worldwide, the noble berry is beloved for its silky texture and gorgeous green hue.",
			"Despite its popularity in cooking, the avocado is rarely approached as an ingredient for use in bartending. But it is a fruit (a berry, even), and fruits have always had a role behind the bar. Margaritas, especially, love getting some extra fruitiness, and while unconventional and possibly unorthodox, that can even include avocado. This Margarita spin doubles down on the green, muddling the \u201csuper fruit\u201d with fresh mint and jalape\u00f1o. The richness of the avocado helps muffle the heat from the jalape\u00f1os, though there will still be plenty of spice. This is especially true if you don\u2019t seed the jalape\u00f1os first, which can lead to an overly hot cocktail. When seeding and slicing the peppers it\u2019s wise to wear some kind of latex or rubber gloves, or at least be sure to wash up afterwards; no one wants jalape\u00f1o oils in their eyes.",
			"While the recipe calls for any kind of orange liqueur for the drink, traditionally you\u2019ll want to reach for a bottle of triple sec. The most well-regarded for use in Margaritas tends to be Cointreau, and many bartenders at cocktail bars across the world use it in theirs. However, there are alternatives, including Combier L'Original Liqueur d'Orange. Like its name implies, it\u2019s considered the first triple sec ever made.",
			"Of course, the most important ingredient in any Margarita, even one with mint, peppers and avocado, is the tequila. The Spicy Mint Avocado Margarita is best with a blanco tequila. These unaged (or shortly aged) tequilas are bright, vivid and vegetal, often with grassy and citrus notes that complement the other ingredients. Using a darker, more robust tequila can muddy the flavors. Since there is so much going on in the drink, don\u2019t feel obligated to go top-shelf with your selection. But because the flavor will still be present, don\u2019t be tempted to go bottom-shelf, either. There are numerous affordable and serviceable options for blanco tequila these days."

The controversial liquor\u2019s origins date back to the late 19th century, when it was first sold in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter as bourbon flavored with honey, citrus and spice. Originally called Cuffs & Buttons, it wouldn\u2019t receive the name Southern Comfort until a few years after its creation.",
			"Like many other American spirits, Southern Comfort mostly disappeared during Prohibition, but it returned to shelves soon after repeal. However, at some point over the decades it was no longer being made with whiskey, but was rather some form of liqueur. The exact details are still unclear, but it was likely a neutral grain spirit that was vaguely whiskey-flavored and imbued with fruits and spices. In 2016, Sazerac Company bought the Southern Comfort brand from Brown-Forman Coporation, and a year later announced it would return the spirit to its whiskey-based origins. However, it\u2019s also not clear what kind of whiskey the company uses in the creation of Southern Comfort or its new expressions, including a 100-proof label and a black label with a new proprietary blend. If you want a particular bourbon base, or rye or any other kind of whiskey, it\u2019s best to make it yourself.",
			"Luckily, it\u2019s not that hard to do, as all it takes is some choice fruits and spices, as well as five to seven days of aging.

The accurately named Strawberries and Cream from New York City bartender and bar consultant Michael Waterhouse is one such exemplar, relying on the simple pleasure of strawberries, white chocolate and cream.",

Additionally, it\u2019s a much stronger and more botanical drink with two full ounces of gin rather than another liqueur. With everything else going on in the drink, the gin is fairly muted, so feel free to use whatever London dry style gin that best fits your budget and tastes.",

With over four ounces of liquid in it, it\u2019s a fairly hefty sized drink, especially after it gets shaken up and foamy. Also, with two very sweet liqueurs and half an ounce of cream, it packs a larger caloric punch than your standard cocktail.

But this cocktail differs in its inclusion of creme de noyaux, a once popular but relatively forgotten liqueur from the 19th century. It\u2019s similar to amaretto but sports a singular herbal-meets-bitter almond flavor, and the liqueur\u2019s red color traditionally comes from cochineal, an insect used for dye.",

And modern cocktails have gotten away from the sweet and creamy drinks that dominated the 1970s and \u201980s. But this interesting cocktail is worth a sip.",

The dark and mysterious drink would have been emblematic of the time, with the Cold War having been just starting.",

			"This vivid orange spritzer gets its striking colors from blood oranges and ros\u00e9 Champagne, which means it can be a bit tricky to make in the warmer months, when blood oranges are out of season. The juice blends lovingly with tequila, and is further enhanced by the brandy-based orange liqueur Cointreau, as well as two dashes of orange bitters. St-Germain, an elderflower liqueur, adds some sweetness and floral notes, amplifying the drink\u2019s complexity and depth; some lime juice helps balance the acidity and sweetness.",
			"When it comes to the sparkling wine that tops the drink and give it its requisite burst of spritz, there are some options. The best, and the one that Reiner goes with for the drink, is to use a ros\u00e9 Champagne. Generally on the dry side of things (at this point it\u2019s a given, hopefully, that ros\u00e9 is not invariably sweet) with plenty of berry notes and an aroma of baked brioche, it\u2019s nearly impossible to find a perfect substitute for a pink Champagne. However, there are some reasonably close alternatives. For one, Cremant sparkling wines are available in regions across France. Made in the same manner as Champagne, but often with different varietals, wines like Cremant d\u2019Alsace, Cremant de Bourgogne, and Cremant de Loire make for lovely replacements. And while they don\u2019t carry the name of the famous wine region, they do generally carry a lower price tag for a similar quality sparkling ros\u00e9.",

This simple swap creates a cocktail that tastes similar to the original and saves the drinker a few calories. It became emblematic of the lighter, fresher style of eating and drinking that was taking place in California around the end of the twentieth century and still drives much of the culinary and bar scene today.",

An intoxicating mixture of sweet, sour and earthy, it\u2019s beloved by everyone from college students hosting parties to serious cocktail snobs working on their craft. Its history is clouded, and its origins are hotly debated\u2014however the most compelling argument points to American expatriates traveling to Mexico and making Mexican versions of the Daisy cocktail, a rum sour, as daisy translates to margarita in Spanish. And however it came to be, the drink is clearly here to stay, serving as a celebratory concoction for all occasions.",
			"Traditionally, the Margarita is a shaken drink, served up or over ice. However, like the Daiquiri, it\u2019s a drink that is often blended; for some, the Frozen Margarita is the natural, most familiar form of the drink. Tossing it in a blender does more than make it slushy, too: it provides an easy opportunity for making large batches, as well as easily incorporating ingredients like fruit.",
			"Often, if a blended Margarita carries a pink hue like the Pink Frozen Margarita does, it means there\u2019s some kind of red fruit in it (or a facsimile of one), most likely raspberries and/or strawberries. However, in this version from blogger and recipe developer Matt Armato, the blended Margarita gets its pink flush from that ruby-hued aperitif from Italy, Campari. Though traditionally paired with gin in drinks like the Negroni, this bittersweet liqueur marries beautifully with tequila. In the Pink Frozen Margarita it adds additional levels of complexity and depth and helps balance the sweetness of the drink.",
			"Those concerned that Campari\u2019s intense aromatics and bracing bitterness would overwhelm the drink can be assured that the liqueur takes a backseat; with only three ounces of the crimson-hued spirit in a batch of six drinks, it serves more as an embellishment or modifier, especially with the amount of other ingredients including blended ice.",
			"While blended drinks are, for good reason, normally associated with beach trips and spring break parties, there\u2019s nothing keeping you from enjoying the Pink Frozen Margarita year round. In fact, it\u2019s a good way to bring a bit of summer to the cold seasons."

			"When most people think of classic tequila drinks, their mind probably goes to the Margarita first, maybe the Paloma second. They may never get to the El Diablo, but they should. This mid-century classic combines tequila with cr\u00e8me de cassis (a sweet blackcurrant liqueur), lime juice and ginger.",
			"The recipe first appeared in print as the Mexican El Diablo in \u201cTrader Vic\u2019s Book of Food and Drink,\u201d which was published in 1946 and lists Vic as the drink\u2019s creator (later recipes shortened the name to El Diablo, as it\u2019s been known since). That first recipe called for ginger ale, and you can opt for the gingery soda if you like. But ginger ale during this time period was spicier than most options available today, the former version having more in common with ginger beer. This recipe uses ginger beer to best recreate the cocktail\u2019s traditional flavor.",
			"The El Diablo offers another important choice beyond the bubbly topper. You can add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and strain the contents into a glass, which supplies a gorgeous reddish-purple cocktail. Or you can build the drink in your glass, starting with the tequila and lime followed by the ginger beer, and then adding a float of cassis on top as the finishing touch. This construction creates a visually stunning cocktail with a richly colored halo on top before the liqueur slowly leaks toward the bottom of the glass. Both methods produce a delicious drink that finds balance between earthy tequila, fresh citrus, sweet and fruity liqueur and spicy ginger.",
			"Today, it\u2019s also common to find El Diablos made with fresh ginger syrup. In this case, the cocktail is usually topped with sparkling water rather than ginger beer to prevent a ginger overload. You\u2019ve got options, and all of them yield positive results, so do what feels right to make this drink your own."

			"While for many years, rum was seen as an ingredient mostly useful for crafting Tiki drinks or Caribbean cocktails, the last decade or so has seen a meteoric rise in the use of the sugar cane-based spirit in drinks everywhere. One such inclusion is in the Clarita, from Belgian bartender Ran Van Ongevalle. The founder of Pharmacy, a cocktail lounge in the seaside community of Knokke in Belgium, Van Ongevalle\u2019s Clarita was the winning drink at the 2017 Bacard\u00ed Legacy Global Cocktail Competition. The cocktail is a stirred beauty that pairs Bacard\u00ed Gran Reserva Maestro de Ron eight-year-old rum with amontillado sherry, cr\u00e8me de cacao, sherry and saline solution.",
			"Of course, as part of the Bacardi competition, he and the other competitors were required to use Bacardi rum as the base of their cocktail. Van Ongevalle selected the oldest expression, the 8-year old aged rum, a rich and indulgent rum mostly recognized for its quality as a sipping rum rather than its use in cocktails. It brings a decided elegance and assertiveness to the Clarita, but those making the Clarita at home\u2014rather than for an international cocktail competition\u2014could consider a substitution, including younger Bacardi rums. As for the cr\u00e8me de cacao, which adds silky sweetness to the drink, Van Ongevalle says, \u201cI\u2019m from Belgium, I had to use chocolate.\u201d",
			"Sherry, which is seeing more and more use in drinks, pairs beautifully with rum, adding some salinity, nuttiness and depth while giving the drink even more body without raising the alcohol content much. And as far as salinity goes, Van Ongevalle also uses a bit of saline solution, which is as easy to make as a simple syrup is, just using salt instead of sugar and adjusting the proportions to around 1/4 ounce of salt per ounce of water. This bit of salt acts very much like it does in sweeter dishes, enhancing flavors without being noticeably \u201csalty.\u201d",
			"Similarly, the two dashes of absinthe, while assertive, is more about adding additional subtle notes than overtly changing the flavor profile, as are the few drops of olive oil that glisten on the surface of the drink. \u201cThe most important thing about our drinks is having perfect balance and flavor,\u201d says Van Ongevalle. \u201cIf we go too experimental, it won\u2019t work. We want surprising elements, and we also want people to just feel satisfied.\u201d"

			"Why does a big sip of Hot Buttered Rum hit the spot in winter? The answer is in the name itself: It\u2019s hot, it has butter and it has rum. It\u2019s comfort food in a mug, plain and simple. Yet for some reason, this assessment isn\u2019t universal. Dyspeptic cocktailian David Embury states in his 1948 book, \u201cThe Fine Art of Mixing Drinks,\u201d that this classic rum drink was \u201cthe worst\u201d hot concoction. \u201cThe lump of butter is the final insult,\u201d he says. \u201cIt blends with the hot rum just about as satisfactorily as warm olive oil blends with champagne! I believe that the drinking of Hot Buttered Rum should be permitted only in the Northwest Passage and, even there, only by highly imaginative and overenthusiastic novelists.\u201d",
			"Embury was sticking a shiv in Kenneth Roberts, the author of the 1937 bestselling historical novel, \u201cNorthwest Passage.\u201d Roberts had all but single-handedly returned to favor this obscure colonial rum drink by incorporating it into his tale. \u201cAfter a man\u2019s had two-three drinks of Hot Buttered Rum, he don\u2019t shoot a catamount,\u201d states Roberts. \u201cAll he\u2019s got to do is walk up to him and kiss him just once, then put him in his bag, all limp.\u201d Perhaps not surprisingly, a small mania was born from it. Even Tiki maven Trader Vic included the Hot Buttered Rum cocktail in his 1946 \u201cBook of Food and Drink,\u201d with a nod to Roberts.",
			"To Embury\u2019s credit, he does single out the chief flaw in lesser versions of the drink: the greasy blob of melted butter floating on the surface, as recipes often call for simply adding a dollop before serving. The best solution to this buttery problem, however, is to instead use a batter made with, oddly enough, ice cream. This can then easily be stored in the freezer all winter, ready for use whenever desired. Once that\u2019s batched, all you need is some rum and some boiling water, leading to a smooth, creamy and perfectly incorporated Hot Buttered Rum."

The distillery\u2019s flagship whiskey is a blend of high-rye bourbon and American single malt, for a unique and layered product. To it, Chen adds the classic Italian digestif Fernet-Branca, which gives the cocktail depth, bitterness and botanicals. Cherry Heering, a bittersweet cherry liqueur, adds a touch of additional sweetness, and madeira\u2014a fortified wine from the Portuguese islands of the same name\u2014gives nuttiness as well as caramel and toffee notes. Because of the specificity of flavor in each ingredient, none of them can be easily substituted. However their relatively low volume in the drink, only a quarter-ounce each, means you could use something similar if really pressed, like another cherry liqueur for the Heering and sherry or dry port for the madeira.",
			"What really sets the Harvest Moon apart is the use of Concord grape shrub. Primarily used in jams and jellies, Concord grapes are found throughout New England and the midwest.

			"Bulldog gin is an assertive London dry gin with a robust juniper profile that stands up well in cocktails. It\u2019s that assertiveness that makes it play well in this autumnal-themed cocktail, where it's married with lemon, maple syrup and fresh pear.",
			"The Modern English comes from Michael Waterhouse, a longtime New York City bartender and bar consultant. The drink has a unique approach to its construction\u2014a gin sour like a Gimlet flavored with pear is by no means unheard of, but generally that means fresh squeezed lemon juice, simple syrup and some kind of pear liqueur or pear syrup. Instead, Waterhouse uses lemon wedges, maple syrup and a pear slice, all muddled together with the Bulldog gin.",
			"Thanks to global markets and imported goods, you can make this drink at anytime of the year. However, it\u2019s going to be best in late summer into early fall, when local pears are at their peak season. The fun thing about using fresh pear rather than a liqueur or even a syrup is that you can play with your favorites to see which go best in the drink. Try mixing it up, using something like an Anjou, Bartlett or Bosc and seeing what best suits your fancy. Likewise, feel free to swap out the Bulldog Gin for something that works better for you, or whatever gin you have on hand. Something lighter and more floral like Hendrick\u2019s or something more subtle like Plymouth will make for a drastically different final product than Bulldog.",

			"In the summer of 1936, James Graham, the owner and editor of The Moville Mail newspaper in Moville, Iowa, took his wife to Southern California for a bit of sightseeing. While there, as many do, the Grahams took a little side jaunt to Tijuana, Mexico, where\u2014again, as many do\u2014they found themselves in the grip of a sudden thirst for something alcoholic. Four years earlier, the choice of drinking establishments would have been a tough one: During Prohibition, Tijuana had some 150 of them. But in 1936, with Americans fully able to tipple at home, the city was down to a mere nine or 10 bars. An Irishman by the name of Madden ran one of the survivors, and that\u2019s where the Iowans headed. The couple\u2019s taxi driver had mentioned Madden\u2019s drink-mixing skills and told them of his fame as the creator of a thing known as the Tequila Daisy.",
			"\u201cAs a newspaperman seeking information,\u201d Graham wrote in the lengthy report of his trip that he ran in his paper (bear in mind that Moville had a population of around 975), \u201cI entered the joint and told Mr. Madden my curiosity was aroused regarding The Daisy.\u201d Mr. Madden was not the most talkative of men, but eventually he was persuaded to admit that the drink\u2019s creation was a mistake. \u201cIn mixing a drink, I grabbed the wrong bottle and the customer was so delighted that he called for another and spread the good news far and wide.\u201d",
			"Why are we bothering with Iowa newspapermen and Irish barkeepers when discussing a Mexican cocktail? Because, you see, the word for \u201cdaisy\u201d in Spanish is \u201cmargarita,\u201d and there are few cocktails more popular than the Margarita, or more obscure in their origin. Graham never said what was in Madden\u2019s Daisy, or (truth be told) ever actually admitted to trying one. But if you take a Brandy Daisy, a standard bar drink of the pre-Prohibition era, and accidentally reach for the tequila instead of the brandy\u2014well, you be the judge."

The Americano is thought to be the Negroni\u2019s precursor, and of course, the White Negroni is a variation thereof.

			"The Martini is an iconic cocktail, but its entrance to the cocktail scene was preceded by several important drinks, including the Martinez, which calls for sweet vermouth, and the lesser-known Marguerite.",
			"The earliest written mention of the Marguerite dates back to 1900, when the recipe appeared in Harry Johnson\u2019s \u201cNew and Improved Bartender\u2019s Manual.\u201d The original recipe called for equal parts Plymouth gin and French (dry) vermouth, plus orange bitters and a dash of anisette, a sweet anise-flavored liqueur. It didn\u2019t take long for subsequent versions to pop up, and by 1904 the anisette had been removed. This tweak resulted in a drier drink and put us one step closer to the Dry Martini as we know it today.",
			"This recipe comes from bartending legend Dale DeGroff, who sticks to the preferred formula of Plymouth gin, dry vermouth and orange bitters. Plymouth gin, which is composed of seven botanicals, including orange peels and green cardamom, is an important component of the cocktail. Falling between Old Tom, a sweeter style of gin called for in the Martinez, and bone-dry London dry gin, Plymouth is soft and citrusy with a subtle juniper note. Its character complements the vermouth and pairs deftly with the orange bitters, allowing all three ingredients to shine.",
			"The next time you\u2019re craving a gin cocktail, try stirring up the Marguerite. It hits all the familiar notes of a Martini, and it\u2019s still plenty stiff, but it provides a softer drinking experience from start to finish."

			"For some reason, when it comes to the hallmarks of the Golden Age of cocktails, the Pegu Club lacks the notoriety of the other big names like the Sazerac, Mint Julep and Martini. Yet it\u2019s still an essential classic, the gin equivalent to sours like the Daiquiri and Margarita, and its eponymous place of origin even inspired the legendary craft cocktail bar in New York City of the same name.",
			"The Pegu Club\u2019s origins date back to the early 20th Century, and to the club of the same name located just outside of Rangoon in what is now called Myanmar. Like many British social clubs in southeast Asia, the Pegu Club was a product of imperialism, a place for British officials to enjoy some libations in their newly colonized territory. Its signature cocktail borrowed the name, at least when it was published in the famed \u201cSavoy Cocktail Book\u201d by Harry Craddock.",
			"As for the drink itself, it\u2019s essentially a Gin Sour but without the egg whites and with bitters. Rather than simple syrup, it takes the Sidecar route and uses triple sec for sweetness and additional citrus notes. Modern recipes sometimes use Cointreau, which certainly works, but others call for orange cura\u00e7ao. When it comes down to it, it\u2019s up to whoever is making the drink to decide on their favorite orange liqueur to use.",
			"Adding bitters to a sour isn\u2019t unheard of, but it is a bit unusual\u2014most of the other big name sours skip them. But the Pegu Club uses a single dash each of Angostura and orange bitters, enough to give the drink some complexity without overwhelming the botanicals in the gin or the brightness of the lime juice and orange liqueur. They also give the sour a subtle but noticeable flush of color, enhancing the lime juice enough so the drink has a lovely golden hue.",
			"Though the Pegu Club shrunk in popularity after Prohibition, it has made a resurgence in the last decade, no doubt partially due to the popularity of the New York bar. It\u2019s a worthy inclusion to any list of essential classic drinks, and one that every cocktail fan should try at least once."

			"The Smuggler\u2019s Cove Straits Sling comes from Martin Cate, bartender and owner of Smuggler\u2019s Cove, the award-winning Tiki bar in San Francisco. The bar is known for stocking one of the country\u2019s most impressive rum selections, but this drink skips rum entirely, instead calling upon gin as its base spirit.",
			"Gin isn\u2019t a common ingredient in Tiki and tropical drinks, but it does make an appearance on occasion\u2014most notably in cocktails like the Singapore Sling and the Suffering Bastard. Gin\u2019s botanicals play nicely with a variety of citrus and other fruit juices, as well as orgeat and liqueurs, which all feature heavily in Tiki drinks. In this cocktail, gin props up Heering cherry liqueur, Benedictine (a French liqueur made from 27 herbs and spices), lemon juice, demerara syrup and two kinds of bitters. Club soda rounds the flavors out and provides effervescence with each sip.",
			"Smuggler\u2019s Cove Straits Sling shares several ingredients with the Singapore Sling, which also includes Herring cherry liqueur and Benedictine in addition to gin. Those similarities diverge in the juice and sweetener departments\u2014the Singapore version calls for pineapple and lime juices, plus Grand Marnier, a richly flavored orange liqueur. The Smuggler\u2019s Cove cocktail sticks to lemon juice and uses demarara syrup to sweeten the package, yielding a drink that\u2019s a little sweet, a little tart, and a lot delicious."

		"description": [
			"So many classic cocktails are born in the bars of great hotels. The Singapore Sling hails from the famed Raffles Hotel in Singapore, while the Vieux Carr\u00e9 was first stirred at the Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans. The list goes on, and it includes the Suffering Bastard, which was originally conceived as a hangover cure by the bar staff at Cairo\u2019s Shepheard\u2019s Hotel before the property burned to the ground in 1952.",
			"As the story goes, in 1942, Shepheard\u2019s barkeep Joe Scialom was toying with a hangover remedy for troops during World War II. He settled on the Suffering Bastard, smartly employing two liquors with lime juice, aromatic bitters and the stomach-settling powers of ginger beer. The drink was supposedly so popular with its intended audience that troops telegrammed the hotel asking for bulk orders of this liquid fortification to be made and delivered to the front lines. Such a move puts your making this at home and drinking it on your couch in perspective.",
			"Today, the common recipe calls for bourbon and gin, though some reports peg the original as containing brandy instead of bourbon. Both spirits make excellent versions of the drink, but this recipe sticks with whiskey. If you can\u2019t find ginger beer, ginger ale also works. The resulting cocktail won\u2019t be quite as spicy, but it will still contain a thirst-quenching, effervescent quality.",
			"Interestingly, the Suffering Bastard took a left turn in the 1960s, when it became associated with Tiki culture. Recipes of the period, including one by Trader Vic, began to feature rums as the base spirits, accented by orgeat and cura\u00e7ao liqueur. But if you want to make the original recipe, skip the rum.",
			"Whichever route you go, this cocktail has stuck around for a reason: It will take away your suffering (although too many of these bastards has been known to increase it). To adjust the drink\u2019s potency\u2014or get a jump on tomorrow\u2019s hangover\u2014simply increase or decrease the amount of ginger beer. Then raise a glass to the troops who enjoyed this elixir\u2014along with the man who created it\u2014and knock one back."

			"The Barents Sea Collins is an interesting drink. Created by New York City bartender Jason Littrell, this highball closely resembles a Tom Collins, but it switches up the base spirit for the unexpected. Rather than rely solely on gin for the base, it\u2019s split between vodka and aquavit.",
			"The drink gets its name from the fact that the Barents Sea separates Norway\u2014of which aquavit is the national drink\u2014and Russia, which is famous for its production, and consumption, of vodka. This makes the Barents Sea Collins a potable tour of the area. Because of this, it\u2019s best to use spirits that come from those two nations: Littrell uses Linie Aquavit, a historic Norwegian brand, and Stolichnaya Vodka, arguably Russia\u2019s most famous spirit.",

While aquavit is packed with notes of caraway and other botanicals, the Linie Aquavit is subtle in this drink amidst the vodka, lemon and simple syrup. However, the aged spirit does lend some color and nuance to the drink, while the vodka keeps things light and easy.",

For starters, Saunders employs aged rum, rather than the Mojito\u2019s traditional call for white rum. From there, simple syrup, fresh lime juice and mint continue the Mojito trajectory, but those ingredients benefit from aromatic bitters and a topper of champagne, which brings a festive dose of effervescence.",

That\u2019s exactly what famous New York City bartender and author Jim Meehan does with the Nouveau Sangaree, a Sangria twist with French and New England elements. While still bright and cheering, the drink has a lovely autumnal quality to it. And, rather than making a whole pitcher\u2019s worth, this recipe is for single servings.",
			"As with any Sangria variation, this one starts with red wine. Specifically, Meehan uses Beaujolais Nouveau, a light red French wine made with gamay and released in November each year. Besides giving the drink part of its name, the wine gives it a bright, vivid base. You can use another wine, but if you do you\u2019ll want to make sure to use something on the lighter-bodied side, like an American pinot noir.",
			"Rather than a traditional brandy like cognac, Meehan opts for an American staple: Laird\u2019s Bottled in Bond Apple Brandy, one of the oldest liquors in the country. Made from 100% apples, this rich and golden spirit evokes the autumn, and its apple flavors come through clearly even in cocktails.",
			"To add to that feeling of autumn in New England, Meehan sweetens the drink with a bit of maple syrup\u2014grade B, which is darker and stronger than grade A. Sloe gin, a gin-based liquor flavored with English sloe berries, adds a touch of Old England. Meehan uses Plymouth sloe gin, but another sloe gin can be used instead\u2014but keep in mind that traditional gin is not an accurate substitute.",
			"One way the Nouveau Sangaree differs from traditional sangria is with its presentation\u2014rather than being served in a pitcher and poured over ice, it\u2019s served in a cocktail glass with no ice, dusted with cinnamon and garnished with an apple slice. It\u2019s like a full glass of Sangria condensed into a single cocktail-sized serving."

			"Lest you were concerned that vodka would get lost among the flavorful mix of ingredients, fear not: The vodka is a botanical peach-and-orange-blossom-flavored expression from Ketel One, which adds a burst of fresh and juicy accents.",
			"The Dutch company produces a few different vodkas made with real botanicals, natural fruit essences and no artificial flavors or sweeteners. \u201cThe distillation process and taste are so distinctive from flavored vodka and offer such a unique alternative to wine that [we] refer to the different variants as varietals,\u201d says Ketel One brand director Jim Ruane. The essences and botanicals for each are distilled at the beginning of the process rather than introducing them at the end, as is done with flavored vodka, so they\u2019re better integrated into the final product. Ruane describes the Peach & Orange Blossom vodka\u2019s profile as \u201clush, juicy white peaches and bold notes of fragrant orange blossoms.\u201d",
			"That baseline of juicy fruit complements the chamomile tea, which lends a delicate floral quality to the honey and lemon, yielding a drink that is fresh, flavorful and a fun upgrade to the classic recipe.",
			"You can easily make the Botanical Bee\u2019s Knees at home by steeping some tea, letting it cool and then shaking all the ingredients with ice. Pour yourself an ice-cold drink, bask in each refreshing sip and consider making \u201cafternoon tea\u201d part of your daily regimen."

			"The Boulevardier features bourbon, Campari and sweet vermouth in a whiskey-spiked tweak to the Negroni, while the Old Pal follows suit by requesting rye whiskey and Campari. But, notably, the Old Pal calls for dry vermouth. The three-ingredient drink is still spirit-forward and potent, but given the lighter choice of vermouth and the zesty lemon peel garnish, it drinks lighter than its richer sibling.",
			"The classic Old Pal recipe is built with equal parts of each ingredient, just like the Negroni. However, some modern recipes increase the rye whiskey while decreasing both the Campari and dry vermouth. The latter formula is often made in a 2:1:1 ratio for a slightly boozier take on the original.

Sprouse is also an award-winning bartender with accolades from Tales of the Cocktail and Food & Wine.",
			"Sprouse uses Lo-Fi amaro and vermouth in the Embarcadero. The label, based in the Bay Area, produces two vermouths and an amaro, and was developed in part by Sprouse herself. The base of each bottle is a wine made with exclusively Californian grapes, much of them from Napa.",
			"The sweet vermouth in the Embarcadero differentiates itself from most sweet vermouths in its color. Lo-Fi sweet vermouth is not the traditional dark-red kind. It is instead made with a white-wine base that gives the vermouth a pale gold hue. The botanical blend, too, is unique, with rhubarb, cocoa, cloves, coriander, cardamom, gentian, dried fruit and other natural ingredients, all displayed on the bottle with a stylish label.",
			"Rather than the Campari used in a Boulevardier, the Embarcadero employs Lo-Fi\u2019s Gentian Amaro, a dark red bittersweet liqueur that gives the drink a vibrant orange flush. Like the sweet vermouth, the amaro is a unique blend of herbs, spices, fruits, and other natural ingredients including anise, hibiscus, grapefruit, ginger and, of course, gentian.",
			"While the choice of rye whiskey is up to your personal preference (and the availability of specific ryes), there\u2019s not much flexibility with the recipe, given the specificity of the vermouth and amaro and the way they define the drink. This can make the cocktail difficult to assemble if you\u2019re not living in California or New York, the two states where the vermouths are most readily available.

In the ensuing decades, it was all but forgotten. That\u2019s because one of the drink\u2019s primary ingredients, cr\u00e8me de violette liqueur, disappeared from the market during the 1960s.",
			"In 2007, Minneapolis importer Haus Alpenz began importing Rothman & Winter cr\u00e8me de violette from Austria right at the height of the craft cocktail renaissance. The liqueur\u2019s newfound availability led to the Aviation reappearing on bar menus across the United States market, as bartenders rediscovered this classic recipe.",
			"The Aviation combines gin, maraschino liqueur and fresh lemon juice alongside that cr\u00e8me de violette, creating a unique, floral cocktail. Gin provides a sturdy base, while maraschino liqueur lends its trademark bittersweet cherry notes and lemon adds necessary acidity. Cr\u00e8me de violette is exceedingly flower-like, so it\u2019s important to use it sparingly and measure your ingredients. Too much, and your Aviation will taste like a bowl of potpourri.",
			"Beyond Rothman & Winter\u2019s bottle, you can also try Creme Yvette, a historic liqueur that was revived in 2009, 40 years after production stopped. It\u2019s made from\u00a0parma violet\u00a0petals and also features blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, orange peel, honey and vanilla. Brands including The Bitter Truth and Giffard also now offer violet liqueurs that work well in the Aviation.",
			"Some will argue that you can\u2019t make a proper Aviation without the violet-hued liqueur. However, during its absence, the Aviation continued to find favor among enterprising drinkers who simply made the drink without it. This was likely fueled in part by \u201cThe Savoy Cocktail Book,\u201d in which author Harry Craddock included a violette-less Aviation in his 1930 tome. That makes an interesting drink to be sure, but if you want to taste the original recipe, you need the purple stuff.",

			"Sloes are tiny berries that grow wild in hedgerows around England. Unpleasantly astringent on their own, they are popular in sweetened jams and preserves, and they develop a rich, tart flavor when infused in gin. Naturally, enterprising distillers have been incorporating them into liquor since the 17th century. The spirit takes on the essence and bright color of the berries, and then sugar is typically added to counter the fruit\u2019s tartness. What\u2019s left is not technically gin, but actually a gin-based liqueur.",
			"To experience the authentic flavor of sloe berries, use a British-style sloe gin, such as Plymouth, Hayman\u2019s or Sipsmith. Most sloe gins are less boozy than their unflavored counterparts, and it\u2019s common for them to clock in around 25% to 30% ABV.",
			"The British traditionally used sloe gin in wintry drinks, but it\u2019s become most famous for its turn in America\u2019s refreshing Sloe Gin Fizz, where it\u2019s paired with club soda, citrus and simple syrup. This synergistic combo yields a cocktail that is sharp and quaffable, with sloe gin\u2019s characteristic reddish purple hue.",
			"The Sloe Gin Fizz is certainly the most famous and craft-focused cocktail to utilize the colorful spirit, but sloe gin can also be found in \u201980s-era favorites like the Alabama Slammer. However, while that college staple may feature the liqueur, it doesn\u2019t highlight it front-and-center like the fizz.",
			"The Sloe Gin Fizz is a breezy take on the classic Gin Fizz, which uses a not-sloe variety as its base. While most Gin Fizzes employ egg white for a silky texture and creamy head, the sloe version often skips this protein-packed ingredient. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to. If you\u2019d like to add egg white to your drink, simply shake all the ingredients without ice to emulsify the egg with the liquids, then shake again with ice to chill the drink. You\u2019ll be left with the same refreshing cocktail you know and love, but one that\u2019s sporting a richer body and thicker head.",
			"Another easy way to experiment with the cocktail is by splitting the base between sloe gin and dry gin. This results in a cocktail that walks the line between a Gin Fizz and Sloe Gin Fizz, with milder berry notes and a fainter color\u2014but one that still features the same easy-drinking sensibilities."

			"The Alabama Slammer might be the most \u201970s of all the bright and fruity 1970s cocktails. Its base blend of amaretto, sloe gin and Southern Comfort stands in total defiance of what one would expect from a staunch Southern sipper.",
			"The Alabama Slammer is one of those drinks that, on paper, confuses. Southern Comfort (or SoCo, if you prefer) is a whiskey-based liqueur with notes of fruit and spice. Sloe gin is made from small, tart berries that grow wild in England, and amaretto is the sweet and nutty liqueur best known for its starring role in the Amaretto Sour. Those disparate ingredients are brought into alignment with the citrusy bite of orange juice and some welcome dilution that occurs when you shake everything together. (For the best results, squeeze a couple oranges for a fresher, better-tasting drink.)",
			"Said to have been born at the University of Alabama, the Slammer is a go-to at Crimson Tide tailgates, where it\u2019s often served as a shot. And slamming one back certainly gets the point across. The nutty, herbal notes, backed by baking spices and citrus, come through loud and clear.",
			"But to truly appreciate the unique blend of ingredients that comprise the Alabama Slammer, shake the ingredients with plenty of ice and serve the drink in a tall glass. The flavors will loosen and unfold at a leisurely pace, leaving you with a mellower, more Southern-tasting drink.",

But it remains a popular drink in parts of its home state and continues to find eager patrons at college bars across the country who appreciate its fruity flavor and heady effects. See what all the fuss is about by mixing one for yourself. At the least, it\u2019s a lesson in synergy and a reminder that even the most discordant components can form a tasty, refreshing drink."

A simple change can be to swap the rum for another spirit, or add an additional ingredient to change the flavor profile, but other variations can be more dramatic.",

A political heavyweight and member of the Tammany Hall group, Rynders regularly engaged in voter intimidation, election fraud and political violence, even helping figures like former presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan rise to power.",

Rather than rum, the drink calls for two kinds of Irish whiskey, an homage to Rynders\u2019 heritage and the political groups he ran with. In particular it calls for Jameson Black Barrel, a version of the famed Irish whiskey that\u2019s aged in twice-charred bourbon barrels.

			"The Salty Dog is a lot friendlier than it sounds. This classic cocktail is a modified Greyhound (gin or vodka with grapefruit juice) that is differentiated by the drink\u2019s salted rim. But that salt gives this drink its own identity.",
			"The Greyhound dates to at least 1930, when it appeared in Harry Craddock\u2019s\u00a0\u201cSavoy Cocktail Book\u201d as a simple cocktail combining gin, grapefruit and ice. Since then, the Greyhound has stayed largely the same, minus the greater public\u2019s predilection for subbing vodka for gin over the years\u2014a phenomenon that also impacted other historically gin-based classics like the Gimlet and Martini. Eventually, the Greyhound received a salted rim and a new moniker to describe its savory cousin.",
			"The Salty Dog was likely created in the 1950s, perhaps by a gentleman named George Jessel, as a way to dial down the grapefruit\u2019s tart and bitter notes. Salt isn\u2019t only for seasoning food. It\u2019s also a popular convention for cocktails; when applied to rims or dashed into drinks like the Salty Dog, Margarita and Paloma, it brings the constituent parts together.",
			"Choose your ingredients wisely when making a Salty Dog. With only two liquid ingredients, the quality of your preferred spirit and the grapefruit juice is crucial. Use a good gin or vodka, as the base spirit will remain present with each sip. Fresh grapefruit juice yields a better drink full of rich, flavorful citrus, absent the cloying sweetness or artificial notes present in many packaged varieties."

The Sea Breeze Cooler, for example, combines gin with apricot brandy, lemon and grenadine and appeared in cocktail books as early as 1930. Another version stems from the 1960s, where it\u2019s closely tied to an Ocean Spray recipe booklet that promoted cranberries for use in food and drinks. So, the drink\u2019s legacy extends beyond the vodka-fueled craze of the \u201980s, which also gave us other vodka-cranberry creations like the Cape Codder.",

In his book, Craddock instructed readers to make the no-frills Greyhound with gin, grapefruit and ice. Once vodka appeared in the United States and started to gain traction circa 1950, the spirit increasingly began to replace gin in the cocktail. The Greyhound bus terminal\u2019s ubiquitous restaurant chain, Post House, served their version with vodka. And since the restaurants were frequented by travelers all over the country, the vodka-spiked drink propagated widely.",
			"Today, it\u2019s common to see both spirits employed in the Greyhound, so try both and see which one you prefer. But be sure to choose a high-quality base spirit. With only two ingredients, there\u2019s nowhere for a subpar vodka or gin to hide. The same goes for the juice.",
			"Over the decades, many bars have used canned grapefruit juice in their Greyhounds. This is an option, of course, but fresh juice gives the drink a more refreshing kick.

Fortunately, one grapefruit yields a lot of juice, so you often only need one to make the cocktail.",

			"The Holy Smokes is fairly specific about many of its ingredients, but one area where it is not is the base spirit, other than it calls for bourbon. With countless bourbons on the market, from rye heavy ones to wheated, bottled-in-bond to barrel proof, you\u2019ve got plenty of room here to play. Anything you prefer to use in a Mahattan or even Old Fashioned will work, especially as it\u2019s accompanied by some pretty bold liqueurs; think of it as the backdrop for the drink, so something assertive but not overpowering will serve best.",
			"However, unlike a Manhattan which calls for sweet vermouth, the Holy Smokes calls for an equal parts mix of Cardamaro vino amaro and B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine. The first is a wine-based liqueur flavored with numerous botanicals, most notably blessed thistle and cardoon; both of which are related to artichokes, making it a bit like Cynar. The other is an herbal liqueur made by monks, only a few of which know the entire recipe (fans of Chartreuse might find that story familiar). Flavored with angelica, hyssop and lemon balm, its most notable use is in a Vieux Carr\u00e9, but it plays an important role in the Holy Smokes by adding a rich, sweet and botanical profile to the drink.",
			"A few dashes of Bitter Truth chocolate bitters will not make the drink taste overtly chocolatey, but it will lend it some increased complexity and hint of cocoa that complements the other flavors. Finally, it calls for a teaspoon of Ardbeg Uigeadail. An Islay scotch, Uigeadail is named for the loch that the distillery draws its water from (oo-guh-doll is the pronunciation), and it means \u201cdark and mysterious.\u201d Like other Ardbeg whiskies, this one is extremely peaty, which means even a teaspoon of it gives plenty of smoke to the Holy Smokes.",
			"But as the cocktail\u2019s name implies, there\u2019s more than one smoke in the glass: the second comes from flaming a small bit of orange peel over the drink. The process is less challenging than it sounds for first-timers\u2014simply hold an orange peel zest-side down over a glass with a few fingers, then gently warm it with a match or lighter. After a few passes with the flame, squeeze the peel to express the oils; if done right, the oils should spark and flame as they pass through the flame, caramelizing as they mist over the drink."

Composed of bourbon, honey syrup and fresh lemon juice, it\u2019s essentially a Whiskey Sour with honey in place of sugar (or a bourbon-spiked take on the Bee\u2019s Knees, if you prefer). But that whiskey-honey combination transforms the cocktail\u2019s flavor and mouthfeel, making the Gold Rush a drink all its own.",
			"The Gold Rush was first created at New York City\u2019s famous bar, Milk & Honey, in the early aughts and spread worldwide at such a pace that the cocktail is commonly assumed to be a pre-Prohibition classic. But this modern invention occurred at a time when important drinks were appearing all over the USA, as bartenders experimented by tweaking classics. Newly available liqueurs were poured liberally, alternate base spirits were swapped into tried-and-true recipes, and rules were broken with regularity. The era resulted in a lot of great success stories, like this one. And in the Penicillin, which was also created at Milk & Honey during this time as a scotch-laced riff on the Gold Rush.",
			"When making the Gold Rush, choose a good bourbon with a little age on it. You don\u2019t need one that is too old, as heavy oak can overpower the other ingredients. But one in the four-to-eight-year range will do nicely. Rather than squirting honey straight into your shaker, try making a honey syrup, which is like simple syrup, but with honey instead of sugar. A one-to-one ratio works well, but if you want a fuller drink, you can use more honey than water to create a lush mouthfeel and richer taste. Fresh lemon juice is key to cut through the honey and whiskey. It brings balance to the cocktail.",

Give everything a hard shake with ice to incorporate the ingredients (honey requires a good rattle about the tins), and strain into your glass. Take a sip, and you just might find your new favorite bourbon-based beverage. The three-ingredient drink is a lesson in synergy and a reminder that, sometimes, simple is best."

It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that bourbon and sweet tea would marry so perfectly.",

A bottle that is good and reliable in the $20 to $30 range will serve you best. Higher proof whiskeys\u2014like a bottled in bond expression or even barrel proof\u2014will be more assertive and cut through the other ingredients. Similarly, a high-rye bourbon will present more spice, which contrasts nicely with the sugar and tea, while a wheated bourbon is going to provide further sweetness.",
			"This recipe makes around 16 servings of the punch, and with a cup of sugar in it, that means around half an ounce of sugar per glass. It\u2019s not a proper sweet tea unless it requires an immediate dental visit; nevertheless, you can cut down on the sugar a bit, if you like.

			"Beach wanted to honor family drinking lore, along with the story of the South in the 1950s and 1960s, but first he had to do away with the Dew. His solution was to make citrus soda, starting with an orange-lime oleo saccharum laced with malic and citric acids to give it that soft-drink zing. \u201cWhile it\u2019s not a direct representation of Mountain Dew, the soda itself is quite good, and Mountain Dew fans can taste the resemblance,\u201d he says. Buxton Hall Buxton\u2019s bar team, led by Brandon Grogan, batches the oleo with bourbon and soda water and kegs the whole concoction.

But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way, explains Portland, Oregon bartender Nathan Elliot. \u201cThe Tequila Sunrise is a classic that when at its worst\u2014i.e., cheap mixto tequila, processed juice and artificial grenadine\u2014can be nothing more than a headache in a glass and difficult to enjoy,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen this cocktail is made properly, with fresh ingredients and a high-quality tequila, it can be a true thing of wonder.\"",

If you want to use your own favorite brand, go right ahead, but be sure to use something comparable.",

And while you can always pick up a bottle of grenadine at the store, taking the time and effort to make your own will transform your cocktails. Start with this take on the Tequila Sunrise, then see what other drinks the spiced grenadine can go in\u2014the Jack Rose, Ward Eight and even the non-alcoholic kid\u2019s drink the Shirley Temple all benefit from using real, homemade grenadine."

He offers a concise collection of cocktails built from pristine seasonal fruit, including kumquat, tomato, cucumber, apple, goji berry, kiwi and, in the appropriately named Fresh Strawberry, strawberries. \u201cThe method of cocktail making in Japan has changed from just introducing the cocktail culture from overseas and adding a twist to a standard cocktail to making cocktails combining fresh ingredients such as fruit, vegetables, herbs and spices with spirits,\u201d he says.",

The sheer distinctions between each spirit is a testament to the drink\u2019s versatility; really, it\u2019s all about the fresh berries, and however you most want to highlight them. Something like gin is going to make a much more floral, light and botanical kind of drink, whereas rum and tequila both bring it into the tropical world. Vodka, and its relatively neutral flavor profile, takes a backseat more than anything, presenting the flavors of the fruit upfront.",

Still, even with the highest quality of fruit, it can use some enhancements in order to really amplify the strawberry flavors; in this case, it\u2019s with a strawberry liqueur and some cranberry juice. There aren\u2019t too many on the market, and your best bet for quality is to go with Drillaud. This French company make a host of flavored liqueur, strawberry being one of them.

This straightforward whiskey and beer concoction, wherein the whiskey is dropped into the beer, found favor in the 1800s among factory workers\u2014possibly those who fabricated the boilers of locomotive engines, hence the name. After coming off long, exhausting shifts, they understandably wanted a strong end to their day. That\u2019s a nice origin story, and it may be the advent of the glass-in-a-glass combination. But it\u2019s likely that people have been combining liquor and beer in some fashion ever since the two drinks entered ready circulation.",
			"There\u2019s no rule saying which type of beer you should choose when making a Boilermaker, and clearly this isn\u2019t an elaborate, thoughtful cocktail. So, the standard advice applies: Choose whatever you like to drink. However, certain liquors do pair better with certain beers. A classic bourbon or rye whiskey works well with a light lager, while bold Irish whiskeys enjoy the extra flavor of an IPA. Whiskey in general is the classic choice when drinking Boilermakers, but many bars serve a lineup of different beer-and-shot pairings. Don\u2019t sleep on tequila dropped into a Mexican lager, or herbal, bitter amari (or malty genever) served with a crisp pilsner. Your options are plentiful and worth exploring.",
			"Those options extend to drinking process itself, as there are multiple ways to down a Boilermaker. Typically, you fill a pint glass halfway with beer, drop a shot straight into the glass, and then slam the contents in one go. It\u2019s a fun way to consume a drink, especially if you\u2019re with a lively group of like-minded friends. But you can also dump the liquor into the beer, keeping the shot glass out of your pint. Or serve the beer and shot separately, shooting the liquor and then chasing it with the beer. Each method results in you quickly consuming both drinks, so it\u2019s a matter of personal preference. Order a Boilermaker at your local dive, and the barkeep is almost certainly going to serve the two drinks separately. It\u2019s then on you to choose your own adventure.",

The Irish Shot is a type of Boilermaker, a style of drink in which a shot of liquor\u2014usually whiskey\u2014is dropped into a beer. But in this case, the shot is a two-part mixture of whiskey and Irish cream.",
			"To make the Irish Shot, you\u2019ll need three ingredients: Irish whiskey, Baileys Irish cream and Guinness. The whiskey and Irish cream are combined in equal portions in the same shot glass, and then dropped into a half-full glass of Guinness. It works best to add the cream to the shot glass first, and then slowly layer the whiskey on top.",
			"It\u2019s rarely a good idea to chug anything, but the Irish Shot is an exception, as it benefits from quick consumption. That\u2019s because the Irish cream will react with the acidic beer and begin to curdle if allowed to sit for more than a few seconds. And nobody wants curdled cream in their drink.",

The visual effects are less impressive, and you lose the excitement factor of dropping a shot into the beer, But it\u2019s less messy and tastes the same.",

Over the years, the controversial and offensive name has been stripped from marketing campaigns and, while still part of the cultural lexicon, has begun to fade.

In this case, the sweet and syrupy coffee liqueur goes on the bottom, followed by the Baileys and then the Grand Marnier, which is the lightest of the three. Pouring the liquids slowly over a bar spoon will help them settle on top of each other to achieve the desired look.",

In the B-53, Sambuca replaces the Irish cream, while the B-54 subs amaretto for the orange liqueur. But the most common variation is the Flaming B-52, a risky endeavor in which the top layer of the shot is set on fire.

			"The Dark \u2019n Stormy is a beloved classic cocktail for its sweet and refreshing characteristics with a backdrop of subtle heat, especially when using a particularly peppery ginger beer like Goyan Jamaican Style Ginger beer. However, if you want your Dark \u2019n Stormy to have even more heat, than the appropriately named Dracarys is a good place to start.",
			"The drink is named for the command word that Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, uses to direct her winged, scaly \u201cchildren\u201d to unleash their fire breath in the seminal HBO program \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d This spicy riff on a Dark \u2019n Stormy kind of replicates that fire breathing when imbibed, says Jenn Harvey, the bar manager at Temple Bar in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cWhile too much spice tends to kill people\u2019s palates, this cocktail has an initial gentle heat that builds as you drink it, ultimately leading one to breath fire.\u201d",
			"Dracarys gets most of its spicy kick from an ancho chile-infused bourbon. Unlike some infusions, this one is pretty simple, easy enough to do at home with just a liter bottle of bourbon or a liter jar. Ancho chiles offer a modest but assertive level of heat, one that can be enhanced by using a high rye bourbon, which has a spicier profile than most other bourbons. Because of the intensity of the infusion, you may want to save the top-shelf bourbons for a different drink, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can go too cheap without it coming through. A good workhorse bourbon around the $20 to $25 range is generally going to work well. And, of course, those wanting to really mimic the draconic conflagration could substitute an ever hotter pepper, but that could potentially overwhelm all the other aspects of the drink.",
			"Amaro Montenegro adds some sweetness, bitterness and herbal notes to the Dracarys. A well-regarded amaro, it\u2019s made with a blend of 40 botanicals from four different continents, and while it mixes beautifully in drinks, it\u2019s also lovely on its own as an after-dinner libation. Harvey uses Llanllyr Source Fiery for the ginger beer portion of the highball. A good level of sweetness and a hefty kick of spice complement the chile, but if needed it can be substituted with any of the other high quality ginger beers on the market today, many of which are even available online."

			"Eggnog, the creamy classic cocktail, is an essential part of the winter holidays. The recipe can vary depending on who\u2019s making it, but the basic formula consists of eggs, sugar, milk and cream, plus a spirit. For the latter, most people turn to bourbon, rum or brandy, and some even elect to combine a couple spirits for oomph. Whichever route you choose, the potency of this drink will put a little more cheer in your holidays.",
			"Eggnog has a rich history with a lot of competing claims as to the origin of the drink, many of which get lost in an etymological debate. It\u2019s possible the word derives from an Old English term for strong beer. Or maybe it comes from\u00a0noggin, an outdated word used to describe a small cup. Or perhaps the name aligns with grogs, the term given to a variety of alcoholic drinks.",
			"That said, it\u2019s believed that the first known use of the word \u201cEggnog\u201d dates to around 1775, but it\u2019s likely that the drink itself\u2014or a version of it\u2014preceded the term by a couple hundred years. And there seems to be consensus that Eggnog as we know it today is a culinary descendant of Posset, a warm ale punch with eggs that was consumed by European monks as far back as the 13th century.",
			"In Europe, ale was eventually replaced by sherry. By the time the drink reached American shores, colonists replaced sherry with what they had on hand: rum, rye whiskey and brandy. Those early iterations of the cocktail had staying power, and today, Eggnog is still widely consumed throughout the U.S. and even into Canada. It\u2019s especially popular during the holiday season and can be consumed hot or cold, per the drinker\u2019s preference\u2014and perhaps depending on how brisk the weather outside is.",
			"Regardless of the cocktail\u2019s origin or which spirit is best suited to the creamy mixture, everyone can agree on this: Eggnog is a universally delicious beverage with the capacity to improve any holiday gathering. And because it\u2019s a good candidate for large batches, you\u2019ll have plenty to keep everyone happy."

			"This take on a rum sour was created more than 40 years ago by one Wilfred Sands. At the time he was the bartender at the exclusive Lyford Cay Club in New Providence, Bahamas. Reportedly, he adapted the recipe for a guest that wanted a rum drink that was \u201cnot too sweet.\u201d Today, he still serves the drink, now as the Head Mixologist at the Red Turtle Tavern at John Watling\u2019s Distillery in Nassau, Bahamas. According to the John Watling\u2019s Distillery website, he is affectionately and respectfully known as Uncle Will, there.",
			"The closest relative to the Rum Dum is the iconic Daiquiri. However, the Rum Dum substitutes lemon juice for lime and plain sugar for simple syrup. It also adds an egg white for an extra bit of foaminess and a silky mouthfeel. While using a blend of rums in drinks is a common practice, here you\u2019ll want to refrain, instead floating the darker amber rum on top, which adds layers, figuratively and literally, to the drink.",
			"As with any sort of rum drink, there is always an opportunity to play with whatever rum you have on hand; after all, John Watling\u2019s rum was not available when Sands first invented the Rum Dum in 1971. What is advisable, however, is to use a light rum for the base of the drink and a darker pot still rum for the float. Pot still rums often have what is referred to as a \u201cfunk,\u201d an aromatic richness and earthiness that many rum fans adore. Using such a distinct rum for the float means that the Rum Dum transforms as you drink it. It starts with the bold wildness of the pot still, then goes into the more gentle, sweet and sour elements of the drink itself. Eventually what remains of the float will naturally incorporate into the drink, further transforming it as the flavors meld. It also provides a visual treat with the layer of rum separate from the rest.",
			"Layering the rum can prove to be a bit tricky. One tip is to place a spoon upside down against the top of the drink, and slowly pour the rum down the backside of the spoon so it doesn\u2019t break the surface."

			"The Manhattan was first stirred together in its eponymous New York City borough around 1880. Since then, it has spawned countless variations, many of which are classics in their own right. Those variations include a family of cocktails named for other NYC boroughs, like the Bronx and the Brooklyn. Dive even deeper into this family, and you find a third level of recipes representing specific neighborhoods within those boroughs.",
			"The Greenpoint is a variation on the Brooklyn (rye, dry vermouth, maraschino liqueur, Amer Picon). It was created at NYC\u2019s legendary Milk & Honey bar by Michael McIlroy in 2006 and named for the Brooklyn nabe. It keeps the same general template of spirit, vermouth, liqueur and bitters, but with a couple changes. It calls for sweet vermouth rather than dry, and the bittersweet cherry-flavored maraschino and the French aperitif Amer Picon are removed in favor of yellow Chartreuse, a French herbal liqueur.",
			"Yellow Chartreuse has been made by Carthusian Monks\u00a0since 1838 using a closely guarded recipe of 130 herbs, plants and flowers. It, with notes of honey, citrus, anise and saffron, is sweeter and softer than its green sibling. In the Greenpoint cocktail, those flavors merge with rye whiskey\u2019s spicy grain character and the herbal, floral sweet vermouth. Two types of bitters\u2014aromatic and orange\u2014provide additional flavor and structure.",
			"The Greenpoint is just one example of the endless opportunities available to play with both the Manhattan and the Brooklyn. When you start with whiskey and vermouth, you\u2019re starting in a good place. Add an interesting liqueur like yellow Chartreuse, and you get a modern-classic cocktail with bold character indicative of the neighborhood it evokes, a place where old-school community meets a flourishing creative scene."

If you think about it, most drinks today are an evolution of another in some way, shape or form, each of which falls into one of the classic cocktail families (think sours, daisies, Martinis, Manhattans and the like). The beauty of this system is that it provides a comprehensive blueprint for making drinks without constraining creativity, and bartenders are living proof that there\u2019s no shortage of innovation in their line of work.",
			"Industry veteran Jacques Bezuidenhout, who also sits on the Liquor.com advisory board, takes the classic Old Fashioned and turns it on its head with his Spiced Old Fashioned recipe, which uses tequila as the base spirit and kicks things up a notch with layers of serious heat. For him, it\u2019s second nature to find harmony between the tried and true classics and his personal love affair with tequila, and this drink is the ultimate representation of the magic that can happen when bartenders think outside the box, which is the primary contributor to the continued evolution of the industry. According to Detroit bartender John S. Neely, the classics are always reliable templates for cocktail experimentation, and for good reason. \u201cClassic recipes are so interchangeable with the seasons, [so] it\u2019s very easy way to keep things new and fresh,\u201d he shares. \u201cYou can play with some many different flavor pairings between syrups, bitters and spirits.\u201d",
			"When it comes to adding spice to a drink, it\u2019s important to keep balance in mind as you build, whether you\u2019re using fresh ingredients, preserves, tinctures, syrups, bitters or infusions. Bezuidenhout has done the legwork here with this recipe, but you\u2019ll likely be inspired to forge your own path deeper into the world of spicy cocktails, in which case you'll want to take things slow\u2014a good rule of thumb to follow is increasing heat levels by adding spicy ingredients little by little, because it\u2019s much easier to continue adding than it is to take away if you find that you\u2019ve gone too far. This how-to video, guided by Beziudenhout himself, is the perfect primer for any foray into both riffing on classics and working with spicy ingredients, so give it a watch before diving in. And remember: as timeless historical emblems, the classics are classic for a reason, but every recipe is ripe for the riffing."

When it comes to the latter, there are usually ice-cold cans involved, but for those looking to step things up with a large-format cocktail, this Game Day Sangria is the answer. We spoke with Birmingham\u2019s reigning cocktail couple Laura Newman and Larry Townley to find out what makes this recipe a consistent crowd pleaser.",

			"Despite its association with the fall season, apple is a flavor that works (and is readily available) all year long. And, according to Townley, pairing it with ginger is always a sound decision. \u201cApple and ginger is a classic flavor combo that\u2019s crisp and invigorating,\u201d he shares, adding that while this balanced Sangria recipe keeps the sweetness in check, you can always add a bit of simple syrup to taste. \u201cIt\u2019s a sessionable cocktail that you can enjoy responsibly throughout the game.\u201d Plus, Newman adds, it\u2019s a great option for beginners thanks to its quick and easy build.",
			"If you prefer your Sangria with a more spirited base, you can experiment with a number of different liquor categories, depending on what you hope to achieve with the drink\u2019s flavor profile. Vodka will fortify without significantly affecting the overall taste, whereas rum (in its many different forms) is often a great way to incorporate notes like vanilla, brown sugar, dried fruits and baking spices while adding to the cocktail\u2019s depth. Many Sangria recipes call for brandy, which also helps in creating complexity and will generally amplify fruity notes\u2014at the end of the day, most recipes can be tweaked to your liking, but the Game Day Sangria is a particularly great canvas with lots of room for customization. All the more reason to make a few test batches before the big game."

Through his books, his bar and his tireless efforts promoting Tiki and tropical drinks, he has naturally created lots of original cocktails. But this particular drink was bestowed with his own nickname.",
			"Like many Tiki drinks, Beachbum\u2019s Own begins with a blend of different rums\u2014in this case, a light Virgin Islands rum is paired with a richer demerara rum. You can choose your preferred bottles, but for the former, Berry suggests Cruzan, while for the latter he recommends El Dorado or Lemon Hart. The rum duo provides a complex and sturdy backbone that stands up to the other ingredients, which include a robust liqueur, citrus juices and tropical fruits.",
			"Licor 43 is a Spanish liqueur made with a proprietary recipe of 43 ingredients. It makes a natural pairing with rum, lending complementary notes of vanilla, citrus and spice. From there, Berry employs lemon and orange juices for a kick of citrus, pineapple juice for its tropical sweetness, and passion fruit puree, which adds body and its distinctive sweet-tart flavor. Mix everything together, and you get a drink that recalls warm breezes, beach sunsets and island sensibilities. It\u2019s no wonder that Berry made this drink his \u201cown.\u201d"

This tropical concoction comes from bartender and brand ambassador H. Joseph Ehrmann, who owns Elixir in San Francisco (reportedly the second-oldest continually operating saloon in the Bay Area), and it\u2019s sure to transport you to some sun-drenched beach no matter what the weather is actually like where you are.",
			"Essentially the Chi-Chi is a vodka take on a Pi\u00f1a Colada, with pineapple-infused vodka, pineapple puree, coconut and heavy cream blended with ice. For the vodka, Ehrmann uses Square One Organic, which gets infused with dried pineapple. Another middle-to-high shelf vodka brand can fill in, but if it\u2019s not an organic one, then the cocktail name doesn\u2019t really work.",
			"For the coconut, the recipe calls for Coco Lopez cream of coconut, which is notably not the same thing as coconut milk (and definitely not the same as coconut water). Cream of coconut includes sugar and other modifiers and thickeners, and Coco Lopez is its most iconic producer.",
			"Ehrmann infuses his organic vodka with a single slice of dried pineapple. The richness of dried pineapple means it quickly and deeply infuses the spirit, and lends it a darker, sweeter flavor than if using fresh pineapple. For the fresh pineapple aspect, the recipe calls for pineapple puree, rather than the more commonly used pineapple juice. Simply cube up some pineapple and throw it into a blender or food processor and pulse until the puree is smooth. Despite the fact that it will end up in a blender with the rest of the drink, it\u2019s still best to puree it ahead of time so it is more evenly incorporated in the final product.",

Larger ice cubes will take longer to break down and will be more uneven and lumpy in the end. Finally, while the drink is traditionally served in a Hurricane or highball glass, serving it in a hollowed-out pineapple and garnishing with some umbrellas and twisty-straws will complete the tropical vibes."

			"The Bacard\u00ed Cocktail became one of the most popular drinks in America immediately following the repeal of Prohibition. It is a variation of the Daiquiri that involves rum, lime and grenadine in place of sugar, and though a rare sight on menus today, it was a stalwart of the 1930s bar repertoire. Its origin, however, can be traced back to a couple decades prior to Repeal Day.",
			"On November 13, 1913, The Oakland Tribune reported on a new cocktail containing Puerto Rican rum, lime juice and grenadine that had been imported from New York. While the Bacardi Cocktail wasn\u2019t specifically named, that may be the first written account of the drink. Soon after, the Bacardi Cocktail appeared in the 1914 edition of \"Drinks,\" specifying Bacardi rum as the base spirit. It continued to be included in other influential works throughout the decade, solidifying its place in the history books.",
			"By the time the 1930s rolled around, Americans\u2014especially those who drank in Havana during America\u2019s dry years or those who\u2019d already sampled the Bacardi Cocktail\u2014were thirsty for the familiar recipe. In New York, it became a top-selling staple at many bars. However, the brand soon realized that not every Bacardi Cocktail actually contained Bacardi rum. This posed a problem for the brand, who acted by issuing law suits in 1936 against the establishments pouring Bacardi-less Bacardi Cocktails. They won, and the Bacardi Cocktail became a government-protected drink, similar to the Dark and Stormy, which can only be made with Gosling\u2019s rum.",
			"When making the cocktail today, it\u2019s best to use homemade grenadine rather than the artificial, bright red versions you\u2019ll find in stores. Real grenadine is rich, delicious and typically less sweet than most commercial options. It\u2019s also closer to what people would\u2019ve been drinking back in the 1930s, when the Bacardi Cocktail was king."

Whether it\u2019s an apr\u00e8s ski libation, a treatment for a winter cold, or just for sipping in front of a warm fire, it\u2019s difficult to beat the simple joy of a warm, boozy drink. Usually when making a hot drink like a Toddy, one reaches for the darker spirits: whiskey, most obviously, though brandy and even aged rums all make for an excellent base for hot drinks. More uncommon, then, is the use of gin. While this juniper-flavored spirit doesn\u2019t see much in the way of hot drinks, it can work well, as exemplified by the Curiosity Killed the Cat, You Know.",
			"This heavily botanical drink comes from McLain Hedges of Morin in Denver, and contains a few more obscure ingredients than your average Hot Toddy. For starters, while the use of gin is already uncommon, Hedges uses a very particular one at that: Monkey 47, named for the fact that it has 47 different botanicals, whereas most gins tends to have around a dozen. Some of these botanicals are hand-foraged in the Black Forest, adding even more wintery notes to the drink.",

More than just useful in slow cooking a pork shoulder or a hearty stew, slow cookers are a reliable and convenient device for making and serving hot drinks. And it\u2019s hard to think of a more welcome and crowd-pleasing warm drink for the holiday season, or anytime during winter, than mulled wine, also known in Germany and Austria as Gl\u00fchwein.",
			"Between the ode to Britney and the subtly sweet aromatic liqueur that defines the flavor profile of this recipe, this easy mulled wine riff is a cold-weather crowd pleaser. The Hit Me Baby One More Gl\u00fchwein calls for syrah; this robust wine is often used in wine-based drinks like Gl\u00fchwein or Sangria because of its dry-yet-fruity and full-bodied flavor profile. However, any good, dry, slightly fruity red wine should do the trick. Just exercise caution when selecting one for quality: too cheap, and the final product will reflect that. Too pricey and well, you\u2019ve used an expensive bottle of wine and dumped a bunch of spices in it. It\u2019ll probably taste good but the overall quality will be lost in the mix.",
			"Thanks to the use of cream sherry\u2014which adds some salinity, nuttiness, and richness\u2014as well as a minimal touch of honey, expect a rich, round mouthfeel. Originally, the recipe called for Townshend Bluebird Alpine Liqueur from Portland, Oregon\u2019s tea-based distillery Thomas & Sons. Sadly, the distillery closed in December of 2019; while there\u2019s no direct substitution, any other Alpine Liqueur can fill in here. The point is to add some subtle sweetness as well as the botanicals that evoke the spirit of wintery mountain ranges and post-ski trip imbibing.",
			"While the recipe calls for an hour of cook time, the luxury of the crock pot is that it\u2019s difficult (though not impossible) to overcook the wine. Just keep an eye on it, and if it goes for too long and starts to cook down at all, reduce the heat and top off with a little extra wine. The other convenience is that you can serve the punch straight from the pot, and it will give your dining table a centerpiece when entertaining."

Some trends include new spirits or liqueurs, others include novel approaches to the craft, like barrel-aged cocktails or sous vide-infused drinks. One trend that rose in the later part of the 2010s was in the inclusion of cannabidiol in drinks. Cannabidiol\u2014more popularly known as CBD\u2014is an active ingredient in cannabis. Far less regulated than THC\u2014the other major ingredient in cannabis, and the one known for getting people \u201chigh\u201d\u2014CBD has no proven psychoactive effect, but has been reported by some users to decrease anxiety and relieve pain.",

			"At Sitti, a Lebanese restaurant in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, every table gets greeted with fresh pita and a dish of za\u2019atar-infused olive oil for dipping. Inspired by this practice, bartender Whitney Neal envisioned a cocktail using the savory-sweet herb blend for a fresh take on the classic Mexican highball the Paloma, normally made with tequila and grapefruit soda.",
			"The spice blend often known as za\u2019atar is ubiquitous across Southwest Asia and Northern Africa. It\u2019s commonly a mix of herbs like marjoram or thyme with sumac and toasted sesame seeds\u2014oddly enough, it only sometimes contains its namesake herb za\u2019atar (also known as origanum syriacum or bible hyssop). It also sometimes contains salt, citrus zest and other herbs\u2014there\u2019s no one single way to make the spice blend, and different pre-made mixes will each be distinct. Neal infuses the restaurant\u2019s blend into a simple syrup for a unique cocktail ingredient.",
			"In the Za\u2019atar Paloma, the infused simple syrup is mixed with Patr\u00f3n silver tequila and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, rather than the grapefruit soda more commonly associated with the Paloma. Feel free to use whatever brand of silver or blanco tequila you prefer, though.",
			"Once you\u2019ve had your fill of the Za\u2019atar Paloma, you can use the infused simple syrup for other interesting drinks. It can add complexity and depth to something as simple as a Rum Old Fashioned, but you can go even further with it by using it in place of other botanical syrups in Tiki bartending."

There are plenty of good, affordable brands out there to choose from, like Effen Cucumber, Stoli and the cucumber-mint vodka from Ketel One. Choosing a cucumber-mint vodka is reasonable, as the drink gets 6 mint leaves added, as well. If you go with one, you may want to taste it first to make sure the mint isn\u2019t overbearing.",

For instance, Lemon Hart 151\u2014an overproof demerara rum that is a darling of the Tiki fanatic community and rum obsessives everywhere\u2014has the habit of disappearing from shelves for a while, and it\u2019s not readily available everywhere. It\u2019s also not the kind of thing that can be swapped out for a more commonplace 151-proof rum like Bacardi\u2019s, but there are alternatives. The most obvious and suitable alternative is Hamilton 151, another highly regarded demerara rum, and one that can generally be found on liquor store shelves. The base of the drink is made with Hamilton\u2019s Jamaican pot-still gold rum, so using the label for the overproof float makes a kind of sense.",

A blend of high-rye bourbon from Indiana and American single malt whiskey from Colorado (where the distillery is located), Tincup is a moderately priced whiskey with large availability. Nevertheless, substituting it for another bourbon, or even rye, is acceptable, especially if you have a high-rye bourbon on hand.",

The recipe calls for making a large volume of both syrups, and each will last around two weeks in the fridge. Because of this, it\u2019s best to make the drink in large batches\u2014say, for entertaining guests\u2014unless you plan on making a lot throughout the week. The other option, once you\u2019ve made enough Smoky Sours to suit your tastes, is to try the syrups in other drinks.

This is, of course, largely to do with the signature drink of the holiday: Champagne.",

Today a number of quality brands produce vodkas flavored with real fruits\u2014Wild Roots, in Portland, Oregon, for instance has a number of berry-infused vodkas, including raspberry, marionberry and cranberry. Each bottle is made with more than a pound of berries, most of which is harvested locally. Other brands with quality fruit vodkas include Ciroc, Finlandia and even Grey Goose, which has a strawberry and lemongrass vodka.",
			"Of course, infusing vodka at home is also an option. This gives you control over what type of berries and how much you want to use. While you can use modern devices like sous vide to do so, there\u2019s always the option to add berries to a vodka and let sit in a cool, dark space for a day or two.",
			"However you select your berry vodka, the next step is to add pomegranate, cranberry juice or a mix of the two. As with selecting any juice, the level of sweetness is up to you, but it\u2019s always best to avoid ones with artificial flavorings and sweeteners.",

Since you\u2019ll be mixing it with fruit vodka and juice, don\u2019t use one that\u2019s too pricey (save the cru and grower Champagne for drinking on their own).

The aromatic bitters, which are usually applied as a garnish, add color and fragrance to the cocktail. Those bitters sit on the drink\u2019s fluffy head, a trait achieved by dry-shaking the cocktail. That means shaking it first without ice to incorporate the liquid ingredients with the egg white before shaking it again with ice to provide chill and dilution.",

The Phoenix Colada, from Matt Giarratano, pushes the concept of what defines a Dark \u2019n Stormy, with the addition of bourbon as well as pineapple juice and a coconut infusion.",

To that end he infuses rum with coconut, adds pineapple juice to the mix and spikes it with Tiki bitters and spicy ginger beer.",

If you\u2019re recreating the Phoenix Colada at home and can\u2019t find Bluebird\u2019s rum, using another white, sugarcane-based rum like a rhum agricole would work best. Similarly Giarratano uses the distillery\u2019s own Four Grain bourbon, and again you can substitute with another whiskey if you\u2019re not in the Philadelphia area. The flavor is particular, but you\u2019ll get closest with a high-rye bourbon, as the Four Grain has a prominent rye profile.",

			"For those unfamiliar, Chartreuse is a unique herbal liqueur made by Carthusian monks in the mountains of France\u2019s Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, and if you\u2019ve encountered it in a cocktail, it\u2019s likely been in the form of a Last Word or Bijou. But this ultra-herbaceous elixir is much more than a key component in classics such as these\u2014especially if your palate is on the adventurous side.",
			"\u201cChartreuse is not classically used in rum cocktails; however, the herbaceous character can play well with sugar-cane-based distillates,\u201d says Scott Woodworth, who originally created this cocktail for the now-shuttered 12@Madison in Denver. According to Woodworth, his combination of white rum, mezcal, green chartreuse, falernum and freshly-squeezed orange juice \u201c[is] the perfect balance of sweet, savory and citrus,\u201d and according to us, it\u2019s proof that green Chartreuse isn\u2019t just a one-trick pony.",
			"Available in both green and yellow expressions, Chartreuse is unlike any other herbal liqueur on the market, and its origin story is perhaps one of the most intriguing. Nobody\u2014aside from two of the monks who make it, allegedly\u2014knows the actual formula of either one, but we do know that Chartreuse is made from 130 different local botanicals. Both green Chartreuse and yellow Chartreuse are quite complex in flavor profile with notes of licorice, mint, gentian, various flowers and more, though the yellow version is somewhat softer and lighter with more prominent honey and saffron notes. The original formula for Chartreuse is said to date all the way back to 1605, though the first trademark for it was not filed until 1840\u2014either way, it\u2019s worth investing in spirits and cocktails that have remained popular throughout multiple centuries, even if you're not one to follow the masses (in Chartreuse\u2019s case, the masses happen to have great taste)."

			"The Mai Tai is one of the all time cocktail greats. Historically the flagship drink of Tiki bartending and an overall excellent use for rum, the drink spent a few years being abused with sugary syrups and fruit juices. Luckily, these days most bars bothering to put one on their menu hew much closer to the original blend of rums, lime juice, orgeat and orange liqueur, and the Mai Tai has been generally restored to its proper place in the cocktail oeuvre. However, its versatility remains one of its most charming aspects, with bartenders riffing on the drink in numerous ways.",
			"One such variation is the My Thai from bartending icon and author Jim Meehan, the co-founder of the legendary speakeasy Please Don\u2019t Tell in New York City and Hong Kong, and founder of Portland, Oregon\u2019s izakaya Takibi. While Mai Tai recipes are often flexible on the rum used, the My Thai is particular when it calls for Banks 5-Island Blend rum, a blend of over 20 different rums from Trinidad, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados and Java in Indonesia. \u201cThe addition of Indonesian arrack to a blend of West Indies rums is what made Banks 5 unique when it launched back in 2010,\u201d says Meehan. \u201cThis recipe\u2014created around that time\u2014reimagined Trader Vic looking to Thailand instead of Tahiti as part of the inspiration behind his most famous cocktail.\u201d",
			"To enhance the Thai elements of the drink, the My Thai gets some added heat from a Thai chile pepper muddled with Grand Marnier. And rather than orgeat, the almond and rose water syrup normally used in Mai Tais, it gets some coconut milk, which helps to mellow some of the pepper\u2019s harsh burn. Since coconut milk is far less sweet than orgeat\u2014and since Meehan doesn\u2019t use simple syrup in the recipe\u2014this frees the drink up for some additional sugar in the form of fresh pineapple juice. The result is a Mai Tai with Thai flavors, perfect for dinner parties and patio drinking."

			"The Pink Flamingo is an original cocktail from star bartender Jim Meehan, who created the drink in 2010 to showcase Banks 5 Island white rum, a brand he co-founded. He decided on a straightforward highball-style cocktail, pairing the rum with grapefruit soda and lime juice. At first, he made the Pink Flamingo with Ting\u00a0pink grapefruit soda, a Jamaican product that complemented the Jamaican rum in Banks\u2019 blend, but he had difficulty sourcing the ingredient as he traveled around the country. So, ever the enterprising bartender, he decided to create his own, teaming up with East Imperial founder Kevin Law-Smith to make it happen.",
			"\u201cWe tasted through every grapefruit soda he could find in the world,\u201d says Meehan. \u201cIf you look at grapefruit sodas as a category, on one end, you have\u00a0Fresca\u00a0and\u00a0Squirt, which are sort of like grapefruit-flavored\u00a07Up, and then on the other, you have like\u00a0Izze\u00a0and some of the grown-up sodas that are like faintly carbonated grapefruit juice.\u201d They aimed to find the middle ground, making a dry soda from real fruit that still exhibited the aromatics of proper soda.",
			"East Imperial\u2019s pink grapefruit soda launched in 2019 and is now Meehan\u2019s go-to for topping off the Pink Flamingo. Because it has a drier flavor profile than Ting, Meehan sometimes chooses to make the cocktail without the lime juice, instead garnishing the glass with a lime wedge that can be squeezed at the drinker\u2019s discretion. Do the same, and you can doctor the drink as you see fit. Either way you make it, the Pink Flamingo is a delicious foil to warm days, with a quaffable character that keeps you coming back for more."

The watering hole is famous for serving venerable regulars like Ernest Hemingway and for turning out some of the best drinks in Havana. That includes the Golden Glove. Consisting of rum, lime juice, sugar and Cointreau, it\u2019s like a Daiquiri-Margarita hybrid.

Whichever path you take, you get to drink a Golden Glove, so don\u2019t overthink it\u2014instead, enjoy this taste of Cuba\u2019s rich cocktail history."

You can\u2019t go wrong with a juniper-forward London dry gin, which works with nearly any juice you can source, from lemon and lime to orange and grapefruit. Softer gins can work great, too, but depending on their botanical makeup, they may pair better with sweeter OJ or more sour grapefruit.",

Sherry is still relatively constrained to Spanish winemakers, but there is a variety there, as well. Fino is a very dry, very light style of the fortified wine\u2014swapping it for a manzanilla sherry can also work, as the two styles are similar.",

Cherry Heering, the Danish cherry liqueur, sticks around in this Blood & Sand variation. Like always, if you substitute with another cherry liqueur you\u2019ll want to test for sweetness before serving, as Heering tends to be on the sweeter side compared to others.",

While recipes may slightly differ from source to source, one thing is consistent\u2014despite the name, this historic drink contains no coffee or caffeine of any sort.",

This laidback refreshment bolsters your DIY repertoire with a thirst-quenching combination of spiced rum, lemonade and iced tea. Take one sip, and you\u2019ll want to break the drink out whenever hot weather requires liquid abatement.",
			"Essentially a spirited take on the Arnold Palmer (iced tea and lemonade), the Backyard Iced Tea doesn\u2019t require much thought or effort, but it does allow for customization. Any bottle of your favorite spiced rum will do. From there, you can pull a bottle of iced tea from the fridge or take the extra step to brew your own. Unsweetened iced tea is the best way to go, as the cocktail receives plenty of sweetness from the rum and lemonade.",
			"About that lemonade: If you want to use a store-bought version, choose one that you enjoy drinking on its own, ideally without too many artificial ingredients or additives. But if you\u2019re open to squeezing some lemons, you can take this drink up a notch. Fresh lemonade\u2014a simple merger of lemon juice, sugar and water\u2014lets you dial in the tartness and rich citrus to your preferences.",
			"The Backyard Iced Tea can be a solo endeavor, but because it is so easy to put together, you can make a large batch in a pitcher and dole out individual servings over ice. A pitcher of rum-spiked iced tea adds a sense of gentility (or at least some carefree fun) to all outdoor affairs and will ensure that your guests stay cool and happy."

			"The Long Island Iced Tea was popularized in the 1970s and remains a beloved drink. It\u2019s possible the cocktail was born out of Prohibition, when thirsty scofflaws wanted to disguise their booze. It\u2019s also possible the drink sprung up in the \u201970s at a bar in Long Island, or maybe at a TGI Friday\u2019s. This much is known: You still can\u2019t throw a lemon wedge inside the chain restaurant without knocking one over.",
			"On paper, the Long Island Iced Tea is one hot mess of a drink. Four different\u2014and disparate\u2014spirits slugging it out in a single glass, along with triple sec, lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat-house hazing ritual than one of the world\u2019s most popular cocktails. And yet, somehow, it works.",
			"That\u2019s because the Long Island Iced Tea succeeds where so many of today\u2019s refined cocktails fall short: It\u2019s boozy AF\u2014nearly four ounces of alcohol against less than half that amount in mixers. Unless you\u2019re a sailor on shore leave (and, probably, even if you are), that\u2019s a red-flag ratio loaded with morning-after consequences. It\u2019s also precisely what a person needs every now and then.",
			"So, it\u2019s best not to intellectualize the Long Island Iced Tea. Instead, love it for what it is: a one-and-done cocktail that goes down quickly and gets the job done. That said, even though the drink is rarely served at establishments juicing fresh citrus, it really perks up with the addition of fresh lemon juice. If you\u2019re making one at home, squeeze some fruit for an easy win. And if you\u2019re looking to tame your tea a bit, pull back the boozy parts from three-quarter ounce to half-ounce, and lean in on the cola. The good people of Long Island won\u2019t be offended."

If that wasn\u2019t enough to mask the flavors of the actual alcohol\u2014namely gin, vodka and rum\u2014 it also gets peach liqueur (use whichever you like, it does not matter), triple sec (skip the Cointreau this time and opt for something cheaper), grenadine and\u2014appropriate for the mid-90s when it was likely crafted\u2014sweet and sour mix. Nowadays, most bartenders opt for a blend of simple syrup and citrus juice (usually lime) rather than using pre-mixed sweet and sour, but if you\u2019re set on making the Baltimore Zoo, you might as well go \u201cclassic.\u201d",
			"One bizarre aspect of the Baltimore Zoo is that, rather than the cola that tops a Long Island or the Sprite or 7UP that finishes an AMF, it gets a glug of beer added on top. There is no specific style required, but in the spirit of the drink\u2014an in an attempt to make its flavors vaguely less chaotic\u2014using a cheap, light lager is probably the best move.",
			"Making perhaps even less sense than the beer topping is why the high-octane cocktail is named after a popular Maryland attraction, one that\u2019s more than 600 miles from its origin at Purdue. But one thing is certain: Drink too many Baltimore Zoos and you too could wind up behind bars."

But whereas the setting\u2019s militaristic Cardassians had their Kanar, and the nefarious Romulans their blue-hued Romulan Ale, the latter\u2019s sibling race, the Vulcans, had no such canonical alcoholic beverage. We can assume that the stoic Vulcan people are not huge fans of intoxicants\u2014such indulgences would be illogical, as they hinder the control and balance of one\u2019s emotions.",

This non-alcoholic \u201cwine\u201d has seen an increased appreciation by bartenders in recent years for its tart, unique profile. At times it\u2019s used to replace citrus in a cocktail, and for this drink it essentially takes the place of the lemon traditionally included in iced tea. However it brings its own depth and complexity, and the varietal of grape used in the verjus can have dramatic impacts on the flavor profile. The Vulcan-inspired tea uses a verjus blanc, or one made from white wine grapes like pinot blanc, chardonnay, or gew\u00fcrztraminer.",

			"They say the simplest cocktails are the hardest to master. This pre-Paleozoic sipper, then, is no exception, consisting of just three vital ingredients. Each adds depth, brightness, complexity and vivacity to this pleasing beverage. With proper balance, it\u2019s a showstopper of a drink, the perfect cocktail to bring out at your next get-together with friends or to impress someone with on a first date. Furthermore, its low-to-no-proof status means you can enjoy this all evening without worrying about a headache the next day.",
			"The H2O Highball is a finicky drink, however, and messing things up can disturb more than just the flavor profile. For instance, when selecting the small-batch spring water that serves as the base of the drink, it is crucial to select one with a strict 2-to-1 hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio. While ingredients like simple syrup are forgiving with their proportions, changing the water to, say, a 2-to-2 ratio could result in a very different sparkling drink, though one that is useful at disinfecting wounds. If you\u2019re in an area where small-batch spring water can be hard to find on store shelves, substitutions include bringing a bucketful of water from a local spring or creek, or just pouring water from your tap.",
			"There is some flexibility in the recipe, and exceptions can be made to parts of it. For those who want something a little stronger, try substituting the six ounces of water for two ounces of vodka, bourbon, rum, tequila, scotch or any other hard spirit, then switch out the watermelon garnish for some citrus fruit of your choosing. Or, omit the soda entirely and enjoy said spirit neat or over ice, with a bar spoon of distilled water to help the flavors open.",
			"While the H2O Highball Cocktail is enjoyable year round, it\u2019s best in springtime, especially early April. In fact, it\u2019s generally best enjoyed on April Fool\u2019s Day. Or just anytime you\u2019re compelled to put in a lot of extra work for an iced club soda."

			"There are plenty of good reasons not to drink alcohol\u2014health concerns, social obligations and financial limitations are all compelling reasons to avoid the hard stuff. And, really, no one requires a reason to choose not to drink alcohol. However, avoiding consumption can bring up its own complications, and one of those is a lack of enjoyable beverages to replace the ones made with booze. While alcohol has its many downsides, a cocktail is a special thing, and its complexities and flavors can be difficult to replicate in zero-proof form.",
			"Luckily, these days bartenders are more and more aware of the desire to have low and no-proof cocktails on the menu. One such person is Nic Sims, a former chef and bartender who created the Rosemary-Pomegranate Soda as an alternative to boozier highballs normally found in bars. It makes a complex and delicious drink that is easy to prepare at home.",

Normally, the drink calls for an ounce of the homemade rosemary simple syrup, but you can adjust proportions for your preferred level of sweetness. Add some extra pomegranate juice to up the tartness and juiciness, or simply cut back the simple syrup for something a bit more dry.",
			"Rosemary is the perfect herb to infuse in the sugar syrup for this drink, but it can be fun to experiment with other fresh herbs. Thyme, basil, mint, sage and lavender can all make lovely syrups. However not all of them go well with pomegranate juice, so it\u2019s best to mix and match to determine which herbs do, and which would go better with something like citrus or a plain club soda. Furthermore, while the recipe for rosemary simple syrup calls for brown sugar, other herbs might fare better when paired with white cane sugar or even honey or agave.",

You\u2019ve likely seen the term in coffee shops\u2014just think of the Frappucino\u2014but you can also enjoy alcohol-spiked frapp\u00e9s in bars or at home.",
			"The Celtic Frapp\u00e9 takes the concept to interesting new heights by utilizing a blend of boozy ingredients, lime juice and orange sherbet to create a refreshing cocktail. It begins with Celtic Honey, a liqueur made from Irish whiskey, honey and spices. That flavorful start is then complemented by a couple of French ingredients: Dolin Blanc, a subtle and floral vermouth, and Pernod pastis, an anise-flavored aperitif. To round it all out, lime juice lends some acidity, while Peychaud\u2019s bitters provide a dash of complexity.",
			"But it\u2019s the unexpected addition of orange sherbet that really sets this cocktail apart, giving it a sweet and creamy element. Once all the components are shaken together and strained over crushed ice, you\u2019re left with a fresh and delicious cocktail that\u2019s bursting with flavor.

			"Scotch drinks tend to be more uncommon than other, more ubiquitous whiskey-based drinks like bourbon or rye. One of the most famous, besides the Blood & Sand, is the Rusty Nail, a two-to-one combination of scotch (blended or single malt) and Drambuie, a sweet, scotch-based herbal liqueur.",
			"The Bee Sting, from bartending veteran Jonathan Pogash, is a bit like a cross between a Rusty Nail and a scotch sour. In it, Laphroaig\u2014a lauded single malt whisky from the storm-lashed Scottish island of Islay\u2014is mixed with B\u00e4renj\u00e4ger, a German honey liqueur. Its name translates to Bear Hunter, as it is reportedly based on an 18th century German recipe used to lure bears (and has no relationship to J\u00e4germeister, which means Master Hunter). Sweet, botanical and rich, B\u00e4renj\u00e4ger adds considerable complexity to the already layered scotch whisky, and pairs with it in a similar fashion as Drambuie does in the Rusty Nail.",
			"To add even more botanicals, Pogash uses a quarter-ounce of Fernet-Branca. This Italian digestif has long been associated as a bartender\u2019s drink, especially in San Francisco where it first caught on as a trend. Botanical, minty and bittersweet, it makes for both a great after-dinner libation as well as an ingredient in cocktails like the Bee Sting.",
			"Rather than use the more familiar lemon or lime juice, or even orange, Pogash uses tangerine juice, which adds a nice balance of sweetness and tartness. That acidity is mellowed a bit by egg whites, which add a silky, creamy mouthfeel to the drink. If the egg whites are fresh and properly shaken (that is, a dry shake before being shaken again with ice), there should be a thick layer of white foam on top of the finished drink. A few dashes of Peychaud\u2019s bitters add both bright aromatics as well as a lovely visual."

Ruppert uses Glendalough double-barrel Irish whiskey in the cocktail, but the category of Irish whiskeys is plentiful, with many options to choose from. The beer, too, is flexible. Ruppert uses Hipster Meets Shark, a wheat IPA from Chicago\u2019s DryHop Brewers, where he worked when he developed the Stunner. When selecting an IPA for your recipe, be sure to use something fruit-forward, bright and dry. An overly malty or overly bitter IPA can throw the recipe off.",

Lemon juice amplifies the fruit and crispness of the beer, and Bittermens Burlesque bitters\u2014which are made with hibiscus, acai berry and peppers\u2014bring depth and nuance. Finally, the drink gets a touch of smoke with a mist of Laphroaig single-malt over the top. However, if you don\u2019t have Laphroaig on hand, another Islay single malt can work."
